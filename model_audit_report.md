## Part 1: DCF Model Audit ([src/models/dcf.py](src/models/dcf.py))

### ‚ùå CRITICAL ERROR #1: Missing D&A in Free Cash Flow Calculation

**Location:** [src/models/dcf.py:190](src/models/dcf.py#L190)

**Current (INCORRECT) Code:**
```python
def calculate_fcf(self, year_data: Dict) -> float:
    """
    Calculate Free Cash Flow for a given year.

    FCF = NOPAT - CapEx - ŒîNWC  # ‚ùå WRONG FORMULA
    """
    fcf = year_data['nopat'] - year_data['capex'] - year_data['delta_nwc']
    return fcf
```

**Should Be (per Guide Section 2.2):**
```python
def calculate_fcf(self, year_data: Dict) -> float:
    """
    Calculate Free Cash Flow for a given year.

    FCF = NOPAT + D&A - CapEx - ŒîNWC

    Where:
        NOPAT = Net Operating Profit After Tax = EBIT √ó (1 - Tax Rate)
        D&A = Depreciation & Amortization (non-cash expense, add back)
        CapEx = Capital Expenditures
        ŒîNWC = Change in Net Working Capital

    Reference: Guide Section 2.2
    """
    fcf = year_data['nopat'] + year_data['da'] - year_data['capex'] - year_data['delta_nwc']
    return fcf
```

**Impact:**
üî¥ **CRITICAL** - This error causes FCF to be understated by the full amount of D&A each year, leading to significantly undervalued companies. For a company with $10M annual D&A over 5 years with 10% WACC, this error could understate enterprise value by ~$38M+.

**Why D&A Must Be Added Back:**
- D&A is a non-cash expense that reduces NOPAT
- Since it doesn't represent actual cash outflow, it must be added back to calculate true free cash flow
- NOPAT already has D&A subtracted (via EBIT), so we add it back to get to cash flow

**Authority:** Investment Banking Guide Section 2.2:
```
FCFF = EBIT √ó (1 - Tax Rate)     [= NOPAT]
       + Depreciation & Amortization  [Non-cash expense]
       - Capital Expenditures         [Cash outflow]
       - Change in Net Working Capital [ŒîNWC]
```

---

### ‚ùå HIGH PRIORITY ERROR #2: D&A Not Projected

**Location:** [src/models/dcf.py:98-171](src/models/dcf.py#L98-L171)

**Issue:** The `project_financials()` method does not calculate or project D&A at all. It projects revenue, EBIT, NOPAT, NWC, and CapEx, but completely omits D&A.

**Current Code (lines 119-168):**
```python
# Projects: revenue, ebit, nopat, nwc, capex
# D&A is MISSING from projections
```

**Should Add:**
```python
# After line 148 (after calculating capex):

# Project D&A as % of revenue (standard assumption)
da = revenue * self.assumptions.get('da_pct_revenue', 0.03)  # Typically 2-5%

# OR use historical average if available
# OR link to depreciation schedule if available
```

**Impact:**
üî¥ **HIGH** - Cannot calculate correct FCF without D&A projections.

**Fix Required:**
1. Add `da_pct_revenue` to assumptions (typically 2-5% of revenue)
2. Project D&A in `project_financials()` method
3. Include D&A in the `year_data` dictionary passed to `calculate_fcf()`

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY ERROR #3: No Mid-Year Discounting Convention

**Location:** [src/models/dcf.py:237-244](src/models/dcf.py#L237-L244)

**Current (End-of-Year Only) Code:**
```python
# Discount each year's FCF to present value
pv_fcf = []
for year, fcf in enumerate(fcf_list, start=1):
    pv = fcf / ((1 + wacc) ** year)  # ‚ùå End-of-year only
    pv_fcf.append(pv)
```

**Should Support Mid-Year Convention (Guide Section 2.9):**
```python
# Discount each year's FCF to present value
pv_fcf = []
use_midyear = self.assumptions.get('use_midyear_convention', True)  # Default to True

for year, fcf in enumerate(fcf_list, start=1):
    if use_midyear:
        # Mid-year convention: More accurate, industry standard
        discount_period = year - 0.5
    else:
        # End-of-year convention
        discount_period = year

    pv = fcf / ((1 + wacc) ** discount_period)
    pv_fcf.append(pv)

# Discount terminal value
n = len(fcf_list)
if use_midyear:
    tv_discount_period = n
else:
    tv_discount_period = n

pv_terminal = terminal_value / ((1 + wacc) ** tv_discount_period)
```

**Impact:**
üü° **MEDIUM** - Mid-year convention is the investment banking standard. Not supporting it causes valuations to be ~4-5% understated.

**Authority:** Guide Section 2.9:
> "Mid-Year Convention (More accurate): PV = FCF(t) / (1 + WACC)^(t - 0.5)"
> "Industry Practice: Mid-year is more common in investment banking"

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY ERROR #4: Insufficient WACC Validation

**Location:** [src/models/dcf.py:75-96](src/models/dcf.py#L75-L96)

**Current Code:**
```python
def _validate_inputs(self):
    # WACC must be positive
    if self.assumptions['wacc'] <= 0:
        raise ValueError(f"WACC must be positive: {self.assumptions['wacc']}")
```

**Should Add Range Check (per Guide Section 2.3):**
```python
def _validate_inputs(self):
    # Terminal growth must be less than WACC
    if self.assumptions['terminal_growth'] >= self.assumptions['wacc']:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Terminal growth rate ({self.assumptions['terminal_growth']:.2%}) "
            f"must be less than WACC ({self.assumptions['wacc']:.2%})"
        )

    # WACC must be in reasonable range (5-25%)
    wacc = self.assumptions['wacc']
    if wacc <= 0:
        raise ValueError(f"WACC must be positive: {wacc:.2%}")

    if wacc < 0.05 or wacc > 0.25:
        warnings.warn(
            f"WACC of {wacc:.2%} is outside typical range (5%-25%). "
            f"Please verify this is correct. "
            f"Typical ranges: Mature companies 7-10%, Growth companies 9-12%, "
            f"High-risk companies 12-15%+",
            UserWarning
        )
```

**Impact:**
üü° **MEDIUM** - Helps catch data entry errors and unrealistic assumptions.

**Authority:** Guide Section 2.3:
> "Typical WACC Ranges: Mature companies: 7-10%, Growth companies: 9-12%, High-risk companies: 12-15%+"

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY ERROR #5: No Tax Rate Validation

**Location:** [src/models/dcf.py:75-96](src/models/dcf.py#L75-L96)

**Issue:** Tax rate is not validated at all.

**Should Add:**
```python
# Tax rate validation
tax_rate = self.assumptions['tax_rate']
if not 0 <= tax_rate <= 0.5:
    raise ValueError(
        f"Tax rate {tax_rate:.1%} outside valid range (0-50%). "
        f"US Federal rate is 21%, typical effective rates are 23-28% "
        f"(including state/local)."
    )
```

**Impact:**
üü° **MEDIUM** - Prevents clearly invalid tax rates (negative, >100%, etc.)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR ISSUE #6: Equity Value Calculation Documentation Unclear

**Location:** [src/models/dcf.py:262-287](src/models/dcf.py#L262-L287)

**Issue:** The comment and implementation are slightly inconsistent:

**Current:**
```python
# Line 267 comment says: "Equity Value = EV + Cash - Debt"
# Line 287 code does: equity_value = self.enterprise_value - net_debt
# Where net_debt = Debt - Cash (per standard definition)
```

**Clarification Needed:**
```python
def calculate_equity_value(self) -> Dict:
    """
    Calculate equity value and implied share price.

    Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt

    Where:
        Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents

    Equivalently:
        Equity Value = EV - Debt + Cash

    This is the "bridge" from Enterprise Value to Equity Value.

    Reference: Guide Section 2.6
    """
    # ... existing code is actually CORRECT, just needs clearer docs
```

**Impact:**
üü¢ **LOW** - Documentation clarity only, actual calculation is correct.

---

## Part 2: WACC Calculator Audit ([src/models/wacc.py](src/models/wacc.py))

### ‚úÖ NO ERRORS FOUND

The WACC calculator correctly implements all formulas per the guide:

**Cost of Equity (CAPM):** ‚úÖ CORRECT
```python
# Line 158: cost_of_equity = rf + (beta * self.MARKET_RISK_PREMIUM)
# Matches guide: Re = Rf + Œ≤ √ó (Rm - Rf)
```

**Cost of Debt:** ‚úÖ CORRECT
```python
# Line 185: rd_pretax = interest_expense / self.debt
# Line 188: rd_aftertax = rd_pretax * (1 - self.tax_rate)
# Correctly calculates pre-tax rate then applies tax shield
```

**WACC Formula:** ‚úÖ CORRECT
```python
# Line 227: wacc = (weight_equity * re) + (weight_debt * rd)
# Where rd is already after-tax, so this correctly implements:
# WACC = (E/V √ó Re) + (D/V √ó Rd √ó (1-T))
```

**Validation:** ‚úÖ CORRECT
```python
# Lines 244-264: Validates WACC is in 5-25% range
# Matches guide recommendations
```

**Market Values:** ‚úÖ CORRECT
```python
# Lines 221-224: Uses market values for E and D, not book values
# Matches guide Section 2.7
```

## Part 3: LBO Tool Audit

### Structure

The LBO functionality is implemented as an Excel generation tool ([src/tools/lbo_tool.py](src/tools/lbo_tool.py), [src/tools/lbo_tool_single_sheet.py](src/tools/lbo_tool_single_sheet.py)), not as a Python calculation class like DCF. It generates Excel files with formulas.

### Formula Verification Needed

The following key formulas need to be verified in the generated Excel files:

#### 1. Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)

**Guide Formula (Section 5.4):**
```
FCFE = Net Income
       + D&A
       - CapEx
       - ŒîNWC
       - Mandatory Debt Paydown
       + New Debt Issuance
```

**Excel Tool Review:** The tool generates operating model and debt schedule but doesn't appear to have a complete FCFE calculation section. The Cash Flow Waterfall sheet is a placeholder ([lbo_tool.py:740-749](src/tools/lbo_tool.py#L740-L749)):

```python
def _create_cash_flow_waterfall(self, assumptions: Dict):
    # Placeholder - would show detailed cash sweep logic
    ws['A3'] = "This sheet would contain detailed cash flow waterfall"
    ws['A4'] = "showing EBITDA ‚Üí FCF ‚Üí Debt Paydown ‚Üí Cash to Equity"
```

‚ùå **HIGH PRIORITY:** FCFE calculation is incomplete/missing

#### 2. Debt Paydown Waterfall

**Guide Requirements (Section 5.4):**
```
Order of Paydown:
1. Mandatory Amortization (required annual %)
2. Optional Paydown from Excess Cash Flow
3. Remaining debt balance carries forward
```

**Excel Tool Review ([lbo_tool.py:682-733](src/tools/lbo_tool.py#L682-L733)):**
- ‚úÖ Mandatory amortization is calculated: Line 689
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional prepayment is hardcoded to 0: Line 699
- ‚ùå Cash sweep logic not implemented

**Issues:**
- Optional prepayment should be: `MIN(Excess Cash Flow, Remaining Debt)`
- Should respect cash sweep percentages based on leverage
- Should follow waterfall priority (highest cost debt first)

#### 3. IRR Calculation

**Guide Formula (Section 5.5):**
```
IRR = (Exit Equity / Entry Equity)^(1/Years) - 1
```

**Excel Tool Implementation ([lbo_tool.py:830](src/tools/lbo_tool.py#L830)):**
```python
ws.cell(row=row, column=2).value = f"=(B{exit_equity_row}/B{initial_equity_row})^(1/B{holding_row})-1"
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT** - Formula matches guide exactly

#### 4. MOIC Calculation

**Guide Formula (Section 5.5):**
```
MOIC = Exit Equity Value / Initial Equity Investment
```

**Excel Tool Implementation ([lbo_tool.py:838](src/tools/lbo_tool.py#L838)):**
```python
ws.cell(row=row, column=2).value = f"=B{exit_equity_row}/B{initial_equity_row}"
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT** - Formula matches guide exactly

#### 5. Exit Equity Value

**Guide Formula (Section 5.6):**
```
Exit Enterprise Value = Exit EBITDA √ó Exit Multiple
Exit Equity Value = Exit EV - Remaining Debt + Remaining Cash
```

**Excel Tool Implementation ([lbo_tool.py:784-800](src/tools/lbo_tool.py#L784-L800)):**
```python
# Exit EV
ws.cell(row=row, column=2).value = f"=B{exit_ebitda_row}*B{exit_mult_row}"

# Exit Equity
ws.cell(row=row, column=2).value = f"=B{exit_ev_row}-B{remaining_debt_row}"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **ISSUE:** Missing "+ Remaining Cash" in exit equity calculation
Should be: `=B{exit_ev_row}-B{remaining_debt_row}+B{remaining_cash_row}`

---

## Part 4: Formula Builder Audit ([src/excel/formula_builder.py](src/excel/formula_builder.py))

### ‚úÖ FCF Formula is CORRECT

**Line 309:**
```python
def fcf_formula(ebit: str, tax: str, da: str, capex: str, nwc_change: str) -> str:
    """
    Create Free Cash Flow formula.

    FCF = EBIT √ó (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - CapEx - ŒîNWC
    """
    return f"={ebit}*(1-{tax})+{da}-{capex}-{nwc_change}"
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT** - Matches guide Section 2.2 exactly

**Note:** The formula builder has the CORRECT formula, but the DCF model class ([src/models/dcf.py](src/models/dcf.py)) doesn't use it and has the bug.

---

## Summary of Required Fixes

### Priority 1 (CRITICAL - Fix Immediately)

1. **[src/models/dcf.py:190](src/models/dcf.py#L190)** - Add D&A to FCF calculation
   - Current: `fcf = nopat - capex - delta_nwc`
   - Fix: `fcf = nopat + da - capex - delta_nwc`

2. **[src/models/dcf.py:98-171](src/models/dcf.py#L98-L171)** - Add D&A projections
   - Add `da_pct_revenue` assumption (default 0.03)
   - Project D&A in `project_financials()`
   - Pass D&A to `calculate_fcf()`

### Priority 2 (HIGH - Fix Soon)

3. **[src/models/dcf.py:237-244](src/models/dcf.py#L237-L244)** - Add mid-year convention support
   - Add `use_midyear_convention` flag (default True)
   - Implement mid-year discounting: `year - 0.5`

4. **LBO Tool** - Complete FCFE calculation
   - Implement cash flow waterfall with proper FCFE formula
   - Add cash sweep logic for optional debt paydown
   - Add remaining cash to exit equity calculation

### Priority 3 (MEDIUM - Enhancements)

5. **[src/models/dcf.py:75-96](src/models/dcf.py#L75-L96)** - Enhanced input validation
   - Add WACC range check (5-25%)
   - Add tax rate validation (0-50%)

6. **Documentation** - Improve clarity
   - Add formula references to guide sections
   - Clarify equity value bridge calculation

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests Required

1. **test_dcf_fcf_with_da.py** - Verify D&A is included in FCF
2. **test_dcf_midyear_convention.py** - Verify mid-year vs end-of-year discounting
3. **test_dcf_validation.py** - Verify input validations catch errors
4. **test_lbo_fcfe.py** - Verify FCFE calculation formula
5. **test_lbo_cash_sweep.py** - Verify debt paydown waterfall

### Integration Tests Required

1. **test_dcf_full_model.py** - Run complete DCF with known outputs
2. **test_lbo_full_model.py** - Run complete LBO with known outputs
3. **test_formulas_match_guide.py** - Verify all formulas match guide exactly

---

## Conclusion

The audit identified **1 critical error** (missing D&A in DCF) that must be fixed immediately, along with several high and medium priority issues. The WACC calculator is correctly implemented. The LBO tool needs completion of FCFE and cash sweep logic.

All fixes should reference the specific guide sections and include comprehensive unit tests to prevent regression.

**Estimated Impact of Critical DCF Bug:**
For a typical company with $100M revenue, 25% EBITDA margin, 3% D&A, the missing D&A causes:
- Annual FCF understatement: ~$0.75M per year
- 5-year DCF understatement: ~$3M in PV terms
- **Percentage error: ~3-5% of enterprise value**

This is a material error that would affect all DCF valuations produced by this model.
