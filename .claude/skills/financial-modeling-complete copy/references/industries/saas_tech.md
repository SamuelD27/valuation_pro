## Key Metrics

**ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue):**
```
ARR = MRR × 12
Most important metric for SaaS
```

**Net Revenue Retention:**
```
NRR = (Starting ARR + Expansion - Churn) / Starting ARR
Target: >110% (best-in-class >120%)
```

**CAC Payback Period:**
```
Months to recover customer acquisition cost
Target: <12 months
```

## Valuation Multiples

**EV/Revenue:**
```
High-growth (>50%): 15-25x
Mid-growth (30-50%): 10-15x
Mature (<30%): 5-10x
```

**ARR Multiple:**
```
Public SaaS median: 8-12x ARR
Rule of thumb: Growth rate × 1.5 = ARR multiple
```

## Rule of 40

```
Growth Rate % + EBITDA Margin % ≥ 40%

Example:
  Revenue growth: 35%
  EBITDA margin: 10%
  Rule of 40: 45% ✓ (above 40%)
```

**Interpretation:**
- >40%: Healthy balance of growth & profitability
- <40%: Either grow faster or improve margins

## Unit Economics

**LTV/CAC Ratio:**
```
LTV = ARPU × Gross Margin % / Churn Rate
CAC = Sales & Marketing Expense / New Customers

Target: LTV/CAC > 3.0x
```

**CAC:**
```
CAC = Total S&M Spend / New Customers Acquired

Blended CAC includes all channels
Direct CAC excludes marketing overhead
```
