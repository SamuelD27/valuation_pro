## Cyclicality

**Economic Sensitivity:**
- Durable goods: Highly cyclical
- Non-durables: Less cyclical
- Defense/Aerospace: Government-driven cycles

**Valuation Approach:**
```
Use mid-cycle EBITDA, not peak or trough

Mid-cycle EBITDA = Average of last 7-10 years
Exclude extreme outliers (2008-2009, 2020)
```

## Valuation Multiples

**EV/EBITDA:**
```
Aerospace/Defense: 12-16x
Auto Suppliers: 6-9x
Industrial Machinery: 10-14x
Chemicals: 8-12x
```

**Replacement Value:**
For asset-heavy businesses, also consider:
```
EV / Replacement Value of Assets
Target: 0.8-1.2x
```

## Capacity Utilization

**Operating Leverage:**
```
High fixed costs → significant operating leverage

10% revenue increase with 85% capacity utilization
→ 20-30% EBITDA increase

Model sensitivity to volume changes
```

## Working Capital

**Inventory Turns:**
```
COGS / Average Inventory

Target varies by industry:
- JIT manufacturing: 10-20x
- Traditional: 4-8x
```

**Cash Conversion Cycle:**
```
DIO + DSO - DPO

Target: Minimize (ideally negative)
```
