4. [Regulatory Risk](#regulatory-risk)

## Key Considerations

**Reimbursement Risk:**
- Medicare/Medicaid rates
- Insurance coverage decisions
- Value-based care trends

**Regulatory:**
- FDA approval timelines
- Clinical trial success rates
- Post-market surveillance

## Valuation Multiples

**EV/EBITDA:**
```
Medical Devices: 12-18x
Pharma: 10-15x
Healthcare Services: 8-12x
Biotech (pre-revenue): N/A (use DCF with probability-weighted scenarios)
```

## Patent & Pipeline

**Patent Cliff:**
```
Revenue at Risk = Patented Drug Revenue × (1 - Generic Penetration %)

Generic penetration typically 80-90% within 6 months
```

**Pipeline Valuation:**
```
rNPV (risk-adjusted NPV):
  Phase I: 10% probability
  Phase II: 20% probability
  Phase III: 60% probability
  Approved: 90% probability
```

## Regulatory Risk

**FDA Approval Process:**
- IND filing → Phase I → Phase II → Phase III → NDA → Approval
- Average timeline: 10-15 years
- Success rate: <10% from Phase I to approval

Discount future revenues accordingly
