LSTM Revenue Forecasting

Deep learning-based revenue forecasting using LSTM neural networks.

Features:
- Multi-variate time series forecasting
- Handles seasonality and trends
- Uncertainty quantification
- Transfer learning from similar companies

Example:
    >>> from src.ml.forecasting.lstm_revenue import LSTMRevenueForecaster
    >>> forecaster = LSTMRevenueForecaster()
    >>> forecaster.fit(historical_data)
    >>> predictions = forecaster.predict(periods=5)
