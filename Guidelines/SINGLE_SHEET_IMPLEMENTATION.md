# Single-Sheet Model Implementation

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

---

## Overview

Implemented single-sheet versions of both LBO and DCF models per user request:

> **User Quote:** "I would prefer everything on the same sheet"

This addresses the user's preference for easier navigation and presentation by consolidating all model sections onto a single continuous sheet.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Single-Sheet LBO Tool

**File:** `src/tools/lbo_tool_single_sheet.py`

**Features:**
- All 8 sections on ONE sheet:
  1. Cover (title and company info)
  2. Transaction Summary (entry & exit valuation)
  3. Sources & Uses (funding structure)
  4. Assumptions (all model inputs)
  5. Operating Model (5-year projections)
  6. Debt Schedule (simplified)
  7. Cash Flow Waterfall (simplified)
  8. Returns Analysis (IRR, MOIC)

**Key Implementation Details:**
```python
class LBOToolSingleSheet:
    def generate_lbo_model(self, transaction_data, assumptions, output_file):
        # Single worksheet
        ws = self.wb.active
        ws.title = "LBO Model"

        # Build sections sequentially, tracking row position
        row = 1
        row = self._add_cover_section(ws, row, transaction_data)
        row += 3  # Spacing between sections
        row = self._add_transaction_summary(ws, row, transaction_data, assumptions)
        row += 3
        row = self._add_sources_uses(ws, row, transaction_data, assumptions)
        # ... continue for all sections
```

**Formula Conversion Example:**
```python
# MULTI-SHEET (cross-sheet reference):
ws.cell(row=10, column=2).value = "='Assumptions'!B20"

# SINGLE-SHEET (same-sheet reference):
# Track assumptions row dynamically
self.equity_row = 45  # Row where equity is calculated
ws.cell(row=10, column=2).value = f"=B{self.equity_row}"
```

### 2. Single-Sheet DCF Tool

**File:** `src/tools/dcf_tool_single_sheet.py`

**Features:**
- All 6 sections on ONE sheet:
  1. Cover (title and valuation summary)
  2. Assumptions (WACC, growth rates, margins)
  3. Historical Data (5 years of actuals)
  4. Projections (5-year forecast)
  5. DCF Valuation (present value calculations)
  6. Sensitivity Analysis (simplified)

**Formula Conversion Example:**
```python
# MULTI-SHEET:
ws.cell(row=15, column=4).value = "=Assumptions!$B$20"

# SINGLE-SHEET:
self.shares_row = 27  # Tracked from assumptions section
ws.cell(row=59, column=2).value = f"=B{self.shares_row}"
```

## Benefits of Single-Sheet Layout

### Advantages

âœ… **Easier Navigation**
- Scroll through entire model without clicking tabs
- See all sections in one continuous flow
- Better for quick review

âœ… **Better for Presentations**
- Present model top-to-bottom
- No tab switching during client meetings
- Easier to follow logic

âœ… **Simpler Cross-Referencing**
- All formulas reference same sheet
- Easier to trace calculations
- Less chance of broken references

âœ… **Easier to Print**
- Print entire model at once
- Better pagination control
- Consistent formatting

âœ… **Matches IB Practices**
- Many investment banks prefer single-sheet models
- Particularly common for pitch books
- Easier to share and collaborate

### When to Use Each Format

**Use Multi-Sheet When:**
- Detailed client presentations
- Complex models with many sections
- Need separate worksheets for different audiences
- Professional formal delivery

**Use Single-Sheet When:**
- Internal analysis
- Quick reference
- Pitch books
- Models for easy printing
- Collaborative editing

**Best Practice:** Generate both formats and use based on context!

## Technical Implementation

### Row Tracking System

The key challenge in single-sheet models is managing formula references without sheet names. Solution: dynamic row tracking.

**Example:**
```python
def _add_transaction_summary(self, ws, start_row, transaction_data, assumptions):
    row = start_row

    # ... build section ...

    # Purchase EV calculation
    purchase_ev_row = row
    ws.cell(row=row, column=2).value = f"=B{ltm_ebitda_row}*B{entry_multiple_row}"

    # Store for later reference by other sections
    self.purchase_ev_row = purchase_ev_row

    return row  # Return next available row

def _add_sources_uses(self, ws, start_row, transaction_data, assumptions):
    # Reference the stored row from transaction summary
    ws.cell(row=row, column=2).value = f"=B{self.purchase_ev_row}"
```

### Formula Patterns

**Cross-Sheet â†’ Same-Sheet Conversion:**

| Multi-Sheet Reference | Single-Sheet Reference | Notes |
|-----------------------|------------------------|-------|
| `='Assumptions'!B20` | `=B45` | Direct row reference |
| `='Transaction Summary'!B7` | `=B13` | Tracked from earlier section |
| `='Operating Model'!G5` | `=G75` | Column + tracked row |
| `=SUM('Assumptions'!B10:B15)` | `=SUM(B50:B55)` | Same pattern, different rows |

**Absolute vs Relative:**
```python
# When copying formulas down
f"=$B${self.wacc_row}"  # Absolute reference (won't change when copied)

# When referencing same row
f"=B{row}"  # Relative reference
```

### Spacing Between Sections

```python
# Add visual separation
row = self._add_transaction_summary(ws, row, transaction_data, assumptions)
row += 3  # 3 empty rows for visual separation
row = self._add_sources_uses(ws, row, transaction_data, assumptions)
```

## Comparison with Multi-Sheet Models

### Formula Example Comparison

**Calculating Purchase Enterprise Value:**

**Multi-Sheet Model:**
```excel
Sheet: Transaction Summary
B7: ='Assumptions'!B5*'Assumptions'!B6
     (EBITDA from one sheet Ã— Multiple from another sheet)
```

**Single-Sheet Model:**
```excel
Sheet: LBO Model
B13: =B11*B12
      (EBITDA from row 11 Ã— Multiple from row 12, same sheet)
```

**Advantage:** Single-sheet is simpler and easier to audit.

### Linking Example

**Referencing Sponsor Equity in Sources & Uses:**

**Multi-Sheet Model:**
```excel
Sheet: Sources & Uses
B12: ='Assumptions'!B8
      (Link to Assumptions sheet)
```

**Single-Sheet Model:**
```excel
Sheet: LBO Model
B30: =B45
      (Link to row 45 in same sheet)
```

**Advantage:** No risk of broken sheet references.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

1. **Detailed Debt Schedule**
   - Full amortization schedule
   - Cash sweep logic
   - Multiple debt tranches

2. **Complete Cash Flow Waterfall**
   - Distribution waterfall
   - Preferred return calculations
   - GP/LP splits

3. **Enhanced Returns Analysis**
   - Sensitivity tables
   - Scenario analysis
   - Multiple exit cases

4. **Interactive Features**
   - Excel data tables for sensitivity
   - Dropdown menus for assumptions
   - Conditional formatting for alerts

### Currently Simplified Sections

Some sections are currently simplified to focus on core functionality:
- Debt Schedule (shows structure but not full amortization)
- Cash Flow Waterfall (placeholder for distribution logic)
- Returns Analysis (basic IRR/MOIC without full details)

These can be expanded based on user needs.

## Best Practices

### When Building Models

1. **Always track row numbers:**
   ```python
   self.important_row = row
   # Use later: =B{self.important_row}
   ```

2. **Use descriptive variable names:**
   ```python
   self.purchase_ev_row = row  # Not just: self.row1
   ```

3. **Add spacing between sections:**
   ```python
   row += 3  # Visual separation
   ```

4. **Test formulas immediately:**
   - Generate model
   - Open in Excel
   - Verify calculations

### When Using Models

1. **Generate both formats:**
   - Single-sheet for analysis
   - Multi-sheet for presentation

2. **Verify in Excel:**
   - openpyxl creates formulas
   - Excel calculates values

3. **Document assumptions:**
   - Add comments in Excel
   - Keep notes on choices

4. **Run verification scripts:**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/validation/final_verification.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Formula References Wrong Row

**Problem:** Formula references incorrect row number

**Solution:**
- Check that row tracking is correct
- Verify sections are built in order
- Ensure row counters are incremented properly

**Debug:**
```python
print(f"Current row: {row}")
print(f"Purchase EV row: {self.purchase_ev_row}")
```

### Issue: Sections Overlap

**Problem:** One section overwrites another

**Solution:**
- Ensure each section returns correct row number
- Add spacing between sections (row += 3)
- Check that row counter is always used

### Issue: Formulas Don't Calculate

**Problem:** Values show as None or 0

**Solution:**
- Open file in Excel (not preview)
- Excel will calculate formulas
- openpyxl only creates formulas, doesn't compute
