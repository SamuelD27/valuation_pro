## 1. FUNDAMENTAL FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

### 1.1 The Three Core Financial Statements

#### Income Statement (Profit & Loss)
**Purpose**: Measures profitability over a period
**Key Components**:
- **Revenue** (Top Line): Total sales/service income
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Direct costs of producing goods/services
- **Gross Profit** = Revenue - COGS
- **Operating Expenses**: SG&A, R&D, D&A
- **EBITDA** = Operating Income + D&A
- **EBIT** (Operating Income) = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
- **Interest Expense**: Cost of debt
- **EBT** (Earnings Before Tax) = EBIT - Interest
- **Net Income** (Bottom Line) = EBT - Taxes

#### Balance Sheet
**Purpose**: Snapshot of financial position at a point in time
**Formula**: Assets = Liabilities + Equity

**Current Assets**:
- Cash and Cash Equivalents
- Accounts Receivable (A/R)
- Inventory
- Prepaid Expenses

**Non-Current Assets**:
- Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E)
- Intangible Assets
- Goodwill

**Current Liabilities**:
- Accounts Payable (A/P)
- Accrued Expenses
- Short-Term Debt

**Non-Current Liabilities**:
- Long-Term Debt
- Deferred Tax Liabilities

**Equity**:
- Common Stock
- Retained Earnings
- Treasury Stock

#### Cash Flow Statement
**Purpose**: Tracks actual cash movements

**Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)**:
```
Net Income
+ D&A (non-cash expense)
± Changes in Working Capital
  - Increase in A/R (use of cash)
  + Increase in A/P (source of cash)
  - Increase in Inventory (use of cash)
= Cash Flow from Operations
```

**Cash Flow from Investing (CFI)**:
- CapEx (use of cash)
- Asset sales (source of cash)
- Acquisitions (use of cash)

**Cash Flow from Financing (CFF)**:
- Debt issuance/repayment
- Equity issuance/repurchase
- Dividends paid

**Reconciliation**:
```
CFO + CFI + CFF = Change in Cash
Beginning Cash + Change in Cash = Ending Cash
```

### 1.2 Key Financial Ratios and Metrics

#### Liquidity Ratios
**Measure ability to meet short-term obligations**

**Current Ratio**:
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
```
- Benchmark: > 1.0 indicates ability to cover short-term obligations
- Industry average varies: 1.5 to 3.0 for most industries

**Quick Ratio (Acid-Test)**:
```
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses) / Current Liabilities
```
- Benchmark: > 1.0 is healthy
- More conservative than current ratio

**Cash Ratio**:
```
Cash Ratio = Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities
```

#### Profitability Ratios

**Gross Profit Margin**:
```
Gross Margin % = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue × 100
```
- Industry benchmarks: Software 80-90%, Retail 20-40%, Manufacturing 25-35%

**EBITDA Margin**:
```
EBITDA Margin % = EBITDA / Revenue × 100
```
- Measures operating profitability before capital structure effects
- Typical range: 10-25% for mature companies

**Operating Margin (EBIT Margin)**:
```
Operating Margin % = EBIT / Revenue × 100
```

**Net Profit Margin**:
```
Net Margin % = Net Income / Revenue × 100
```
- Typical range: 5-20% for profitable companies

**Return on Equity (ROE)**:
```
ROE % = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity × 100
```
- Benchmark: > 15% is strong, > 20% is excellent
- DuPont Analysis: ROE = (Net Margin) × (Asset Turnover) × (Equity Multiplier)

**Return on Assets (ROA)**:
```
ROA % = Net Income / Total Assets × 100
```
- Benchmark: 5% average, > 10% is strong

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**:
```
ROIC = NOPAT / (Total Debt + Total Equity - Cash)
```
- If ROIC > WACC, company creates value

#### Leverage Ratios

**Debt-to-Equity**:
```
D/E Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity
```
- Benchmark: < 1.0 conservative, 1.0-2.0 moderate, > 2.0 aggressive
- Varies significantly by industry

**Debt-to-EBITDA**:
```
Debt/EBITDA = Total Debt / EBITDA
```
- Benchmark: < 3.0x is healthy, > 5.0x is risky
- Banks typically cap lending at 4-6x Debt/EBITDA

**Interest Coverage Ratio**:
```
Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense
```
- Benchmark: > 3.0x is healthy, < 1.5x is risky

**Fixed Charge Coverage**:
```
Fixed Charge Coverage = (EBIT + Fixed Charges) / (Fixed Charges + Interest)
```

#### Efficiency Ratios

**Asset Turnover**:
```
Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets
```
- Higher is better; measures asset utilization efficiency

**Inventory Turnover**:
```
Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory
```
- Higher indicates efficient inventory management
- Benchmark varies: Grocery 16x, Retail 5-8x, Manufacturing 4-6x

**Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)**:
```
DIO = 365 / Inventory Turnover
```

**Accounts Receivable Turnover**:
```
A/R Turnover = Revenue / Average A/R
```

**Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**:
```
DSO = 365 / A/R Turnover
```
- Lower is better; measures collection efficiency
- Benchmark: 30-60 days for most industries

**Accounts Payable Turnover**:
```
A/P Turnover = COGS / Average A/P
```

**Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)**:
```
DPO = 365 / A/P Turnover
```

**Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)**:
```
CCC = DIO + DSO - DPO
```
- Lower is better; measures working capital efficiency
- Negative CCC is ideal (collect before paying suppliers)

### 1.3 Quality of Earnings Analysis and Red Flags

**Purpose**: Assess sustainability and reliability of reported earnings

#### Revenue Quality Red Flags

1. **Aggressive Revenue Recognition**:
   - Revenue recognized before delivery/completion
   - Channel stuffing (forcing excess inventory on distributors)
   - Bill-and-hold arrangements

2. **Revenue Concentration**:
   - > 20% from single customer (high risk)
   - > 50% from top 5 customers (moderate risk)

3. **Inconsistent Growth Patterns**:
   - Sudden spikes in Q4 (quarter-end stuffing)
   - Revenue growth >> industry growth (unsustainable)

4. **Accounts Receivable Issues**:
   - A/R growing faster than revenue
   - Increasing DSO trend
   - Aging receivables (> 90 days)

#### Expense and EBITDA Red Flags

1. **Capitalization of Operating Expenses**:
   - Improperly capitalizing R&D or software development
   - Inflates EBITDA, understates true operating costs

2. **Deferred Maintenance**:
   - CapEx << Depreciation (asset base deteriorating)
   - Normal CapEx as % of revenue: 3-5% for asset-light, 8-15% for asset-heavy

3. **Non-Recurring Items**:
   - Frequent "one-time" charges (not actually one-time)
   - Gains from asset sales inflating EBITDA

4. **Related Party Transactions**:
   - Transactions with subsidiaries/affiliates at non-market rates
   - Excessive management compensation

#### Cash Flow Red Flags

1. **Divergence Between Net Income and CFO**:
   - CFO < Net Income consistently (earnings not converting to cash)
   - Caused by: aggressive accruals, rising working capital

2. **Working Capital Manipulation**:
   - End-of-period A/P management (delaying payments)
   - Pre-year-end collection push

3. **Negative Free Cash Flow**:
   - FCF = CFO - CapEx
   - Persistent negative FCF requires external financing

### 1.4 Working Capital Analysis and NWC Calculations

#### Net Working Capital (NWC) Formula

**Standard Definition**:
```
NWC = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
```

**Operating Working Capital** (excludes financing items):
```
Operating NWC = (A/R + Inventory + Prepaid) - (A/P + Accrued Expenses)
```
- Excludes: Cash, Short-term Debt, Current portion of LT Debt

**Change in NWC**:
```
ΔNWC = NWC(t) - NWC(t-1)
```

**Impact on Cash Flow**:
- Increase in NWC = Cash Outflow (negative for FCF)
- Decrease in NWC = Cash Inflow (positive for FCF)

**Example**:
```
Year 1: NWC = $100M
Year 2: NWC = $120M
ΔNWC = $120M - $100M = $20M (cash outflow)

In FCF calculation:
FCF = CFO - CapEx
    = (Net Income + D&A - ΔNWC) - CapEx
```

#### NWC as % of Revenue

**Formula**:
```
NWC % = NWC / Revenue × 100
```
- Typical range: 10-25% of revenue
- Used for forecasting future NWC needs

**Working Capital Requirement Calculation for M&A**:
- Historical Average Method: Average last 12 months
- Percentage of Revenue Method: Based on historical NWC/Revenue ratio

### 1.5 EBITDA vs EBIT vs Net Income: When to Use Each

#### EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization)

**Calculation**:
```
Method 1 (Top-Down):
Revenue
- COGS
- Operating Expenses (excluding D&A)
= EBITDA

Method 2 (Bottom-Up from Net Income):
Net Income
+ Interest Expense
+ Taxes
+ Depreciation
+ Amortization
= EBITDA
```

**When to Use**:
- Comparing companies with different capital structures
- Capital-intensive industries (removes D&A differences)
- LBO analysis (measures cash generation capacity)
- Enterprise Value multiples (EV/EBITDA)

**Limitations**:
- Ignores CapEx requirements
- Can overstate cash generation for capital-intensive businesses
- Not a GAAP measure (subject to manipulation)

#### EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)

**Calculation**:
```
EBIT = Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses (including D&A)
Or: EBIT = EBITDA - D&A
Or: EBIT = Net Income + Interest + Taxes
```

**When to Use**:
- Capital-intensive industries (includes D&A reality)
- EV/EBIT multiples for asset-heavy companies
- When D&A is significant portion of costs

#### Net Income (Bottom Line)

**When to Use**:
- Equity valuation (P/E multiples)
- Shareholder return analysis
- Most conservative measure of profitability
- Required for EPS and ROE calculations

**Hierarchy Summary**:
```
Revenue (Top Line)
- COGS
= Gross Profit
- Operating Expenses (excluding D&A)
= EBITDA
- D&A
= EBIT (Operating Income)
- Interest
= EBT (Earnings Before Tax)
- Taxes
= Net Income (Bottom Line)
```

**Industry Standards**:
- **Software/Tech**: Focus on EBITDA (asset-light)
- **Manufacturing**: Focus on EBIT (D&A significant)
- **Financial Services**: Focus on Net Income (P/E multiples)
- **Real Estate**: Focus on NOI (Net Operating Income) or FFO

### 1.6 Normalizing Adjustments for One-Time Items

**Purpose**: Adjust financials to reflect sustainable, recurring earnings

#### Common Normalizing Adjustments

**Type 1: Non-Recurring Items (Remove)**:
1. Restructuring charges
2. Legal settlements
3. Asset impairments/write-downs
4. Gains/losses from asset sales
5. M&A transaction costs
6. Discontinued operations
7. One-time bonuses or severance
8. Litigation costs

**Type 2: Owner-Related Adjustments (Private Companies)**:
1. Excess owner compensation
   - Adjust to market-rate compensation
   - Example: Owner paid $500K, market rate $200K → Add back $300K
2. Personal expenses run through business
   - Personal travel, vehicles, family member salaries
3. Non-operating assets/income
   - Real estate held for personal use
   - Investment income unrelated to operations

**Tax Adjustments**:
```
When removing a $10M non-recurring expense:
Tax Impact = $10M × Tax Rate
Example: $10M × 25% = $2.5M tax benefit removed

Adjusted Net Income = Reported NI + $10M - $2.5M = Reported NI + $7.5M
```

**Example Normalization**:
```
Reported EBITDA: $15M
Adjustments:
+ Restructuring charge: $2M
+ Legal settlement: $3M
+ Excess owner comp: $1M
- One-time gain on asset sale: ($4M)
= Normalized EBITDA: $17M
```

**Best Practices**:
- Document all adjustments with supporting evidence
- Be conservative (buyer's perspective)
- Industry comparables for add-back validation
- Consistent treatment across historical periods

## 2. DCF (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) VALUATION

### 2.1 Complete DCF Methodology Step-by-Step

**DCF Overview**: Values a company based on present value of future cash flows

**Core Components**:
1. Forecast Period (explicit forecasts): 5-10 years
2. Terminal Value (perpetuity value beyond forecast)
3. Discount Rate (WACC or Cost of Equity)
4. Enterprise Value calculation
5. Equity Value bridge

### 2.2 Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) Calculation

**FCFF Formula (Starting from EBIT)**:
```
FCFF = EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate)              [= NOPAT]
       + Depreciation & Amortization       [Non-cash expense]
       - Capital Expenditures              [Cash outflow]
       - Change in Net Working Capital     [ΔNWC]
```

**Alternative: Starting from Net Income**:
```
FCFF = Net Income
       + Interest Expense × (1 - Tax Rate)  [Add back after-tax interest]
       + Depreciation & Amortization
       - Capital Expenditures
       - ΔNWC
```

**Alternative: Starting from CFO**:
```
FCFF = Cash Flow from Operations
       + Interest Expense × (1 - Tax Rate)
       - Capital Expenditures
```

**Key Variables**:

**NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax)**:
```
NOPAT = EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate)
```
- Capital-structure neutral (excludes interest)
- After-tax operating profit

**CapEx**:
```
CapEx = PP&E(ending) - PP&E(beginning) + Depreciation
```
- Maintenance CapEx: Replaces existing assets (~= Depreciation)
- Growth CapEx: Expands capacity (> Depreciation)
- Typical as % of Revenue: 2-4% (asset-light), 8-15% (asset-heavy)

**ΔNWC**:
```
ΔNWC = NWC(t) - NWC(t-1)
```
- If positive: cash outflow (subtract from FCF)
- If negative: cash inflow (add to FCF)

**Example FCFF Calculation**:
```
EBIT: $100M
Tax Rate: 25%
D&A: $10M
CapEx: $15M
ΔNWC: $5M

FCFF = $100M × (1 - 0.25) + $10M - $15M - $5M
     = $75M + $10M - $15M - $5M
     = $65M
```

### 2.3 Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) vs FCFF

**FCFE Formula**:
```
FCFE = Net Income
       + Depreciation & Amortization
       - Capital Expenditures
       - ΔNWC
       + Net Borrowing (Debt Issued - Debt Repaid)
```

**Alternative from FCFF**:
```
FCFE = FCFF
       - Interest × (1 - Tax Rate)
       + Net Borrowing
```

**When to Use**:
- **FCFF**: Most common in investment banking
  - Discounted at WACC
  - Values entire firm (Enterprise Value)
  - Capital-structure neutral

- **FCFE**: Equity valuation
  - Discounted at Cost of Equity
  - Values equity directly
  - Used when capital structure is stable

**Example**:
```
FCFF: $65M (from above)
Interest Expense: $10M
Tax Rate: 25%
Net Borrowing: $5M

FCFE = $65M - $10M × (1 - 0.25) + $5M
     = $65M - $7.5M + $5M
     = $62.5M
```

### 2.4 Revenue and EBITDA Forecasting Techniques

#### Historical Analysis (3-5 years)

**Revenue Growth Analysis**:
```
YoY Growth % = (Revenue(t) / Revenue(t-1)) - 1

CAGR = (Revenue(end) / Revenue(start))^(1/years) - 1
```

#### Forecasting Methods

**1. Historical Growth Method**:
- Use historical CAGR
- Apply declining growth rate over forecast period
- Example: Year 1: 15%, Year 2: 12%, Year 3: 10%, etc.

**2. Regression Analysis**:
```python
# Simple linear regression
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

years = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).reshape(-1, 1)
revenue = np.array([100, 115, 130, 145, 165])

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(years, revenue)
forecast_year_6 = model.predict([[6]])
```

**3. Top-Down (Market Sizing)**:
```
Revenue = Total Addressable Market (TAM)
          × Market Share %
          × Penetration Rate %
```

**Example**:
```
TAM (US Market): $100B
Expected Market Share: 2%
Penetration Rate: 50%

Revenue = $100B × 2% × 50% = $1B
```

**4. Bottom-Up (Unit Economics)**:
```
Revenue = Units Sold × Price per Unit

Example (SaaS):
Revenue = Number of Customers × Annual Contract Value (ACV)
        = (New Customers + Existing Customers - Churn) × ACV
```

#### EBITDA Forecasting

**Method 1: EBITDA Margin Approach**:
```
EBITDA = Revenue × EBITDA Margin %
```
- Base margin % on historical average or peer benchmarks
- Apply margin expansion/compression assumptions

**Method 2: Line-by-Line Build**:
```
Revenue
- COGS (as % of Revenue)
- Operating Expenses:
  - SG&A (as % of Revenue)
  - R&D (as % of Revenue)
= EBITDA
```

**Operating Leverage**:
- Fixed costs remain constant → margins expand with revenue growth
- Variable costs scale with revenue

### 2.5 Operating Assumptions

**Standard Assumptions as % of Revenue**:

| Line Item | Asset-Light (Software) | Asset-Heavy (Manufacturing) |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| COGS % | 15-25% | 60-75% |
| Gross Margin % | 75-85% | 25-40% |
| R&D % | 15-25% | 5-10% |
| SG&A % | 30-50% | 10-20% |
| EBITDA Margin % | 20-40% | 10-20% |
| D&A % | 2-5% | 5-10% |
| CapEx % | 2-4% | 8-15% |
| NWC % | 10-15% | 20-30% |

**Tax Rate**:
- US Federal: 21% (post-2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act)
- State/Local: 0-10%
- Effective Tax Rate: Typically 23-28% (including state)
- Use company's historical effective rate or statutory rate

### 2.6 Terminal Value Calculation

**Two Methods**: Gordon Growth Model and Exit Multiple Method

#### Method 1: Gordon Growth Model (Perpetuity Growth)

**Formula**:
```
Terminal Value = FCF(final year) × (1 + g) / (WACC - g)

Where:
g = perpetual growth rate
```

**Example**:
```
Year 5 FCFF: $100M
Perpetual Growth Rate (g): 2.5%
WACC: 9%

TV = $100M × (1 + 0.025) / (0.09 - 0.025)
   = $102.5M / 0.065
   = $1,577M
```

**Growth Rate Guidelines**:
- **Conservative**: 2-3% (GDP growth rate)
- **Never Exceed**: Long-term GDP growth + inflation (3-4% for US)
- **Logic**: Company cannot grow faster than economy forever

**When to Use**:
- Mature, stable companies
- Predictable growth patterns
- Companies with indefinite life

#### Method 2: Exit Multiple Method

**Formula**:
```
Terminal Value = Exit Multiple × Final Year Metric

Common multiples:
- EV/EBITDA (most common)
- EV/EBIT
- EV/Revenue (high-growth unprofitable)
```

**Example**:
```
Year 5 EBITDA: $150M
Exit Multiple: 10.0x (based on current trading comps)

TV = 10.0x × $150M = $1,500M
```

**Exit Multiple Selection**:
- Use current trading multiples of comparable companies
- Apply 0.5-1.0x discount to current multiples (conservative)
- Typical ranges:
  - Tech/Software: 12-20x EBITDA
  - Industrial: 8-12x EBITDA
  - Retail: 6-10x EBITDA

**When to Use**:
- When comparable multiples are reliable
- Market-based validation
- Expected exit event (LBO context)

#### Comparison & Cross-Check

**Best Practice**: Calculate both methods and compare

**Implied Checks**:
```
From Exit Multiple, derive implied growth:
g = WACC - [FCF(final) × (1 + g) / TV]

From Perpetuity Growth, derive implied multiple:
Implied Multiple = TV / EBITDA(final year)
```

**Example**:
```
If Exit Multiple TV = $1,500M
And FCF Year 5 = $100M
WACC = 9%

Implied g = 9% - ($100M × (1 + g) / $1,500M)
Solving: g ≈ 2.7%

If this seems reasonable, validates exit multiple approach.
```

### 2.7 WACC Calculation Breakdown

**WACC Formula**:
```
WACC = (E/V × Re) + (D/V × Rd × (1 - T))

Where:
E = Market Value of Equity
D = Market Value of Debt
V = E + D (Total Value)
Re = Cost of Equity
Rd = Cost of Debt
T = Tax Rate
```

#### Cost of Equity (Re): CAPM Formula

**Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**:
```
Re = Rf + β × (Rm - Rf)

Where:
Rf = Risk-free rate
β (Beta) = Stock's systematic risk
Rm = Expected market return
(Rm - Rf) = Market risk premium
```

**Component Sources**:

**1. Risk-Free Rate (Rf)**:
- Use 10-year US Treasury yield
- Current range (2025): 3.5-5.0%
- Source: US Treasury website, Bloomberg, FRED

**2. Beta (β)**:
- Measures stock volatility vs. market
- β = 1: Moves with market
- β > 1: More volatile than market
- β < 1: Less volatile than market

**Sources**:
- Bloomberg adjusted beta (most common)
- Yahoo Finance, CapIQ, FactSet
- Calculate using regression: Cov(Stock, Market) / Var(Market)

**Unlevered vs. Levered Beta**:
```
Unlevered Beta (Asset Beta):
βu = βL / [1 + (1 - T) × (D/E)]

Relevered Beta:
βL = βu × [1 + (1 - T) × (D/E)]
```

**3. Market Risk Premium (Rm - Rf)**:
- Historical average: 5-7% (US equity premium)
- Standard assumption: 5.5-6.0%
- Source: Damodaran data, CFA Institute, academic studies

**Cost of Equity Example**:
```
Rf = 4.0%
β = 1.2
Market Risk Premium = 6.0%

Re = 4.0% + 1.2 × 6.0% = 4.0% + 7.2% = 11.2%
```

#### Cost of Debt (Rd)

**Formula**:
```
Rd (after-tax) = Yield to Maturity (YTM) × (1 - Tax Rate)
```

**Sources for Rd**:
1. **Existing Debt**: YTM on company's outstanding bonds
2. **Synthetic Rating**: Estimate based on Interest Coverage ratio
3. **Comparable Debt**: Similar companies' debt yields

**Interest Coverage to Credit Rating**:
| Interest Coverage | Credit Rating | Typical Spread over Rf |
|------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| > 8.5x | AAA/AA | 0.5-0.8% |
| 6.5-8.5x | A | 0.8-1.2% |
| 3.5-6.5x | BBB | 1.5-2.5% |
| 2.5-3.5x | BB | 2.5-4.0% |
| 1.5-2.5x | B | 4.0-6.0% |
| < 1.5x | CCC | 6.0-10.0%+ |

**Example**:
```
Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest = 5.0x → BBB rating
Rf = 4.0%
Credit Spread = 2.0%
Rd (pre-tax) = 4.0% + 2.0% = 6.0%
Tax Rate = 25%

Rd (after-tax) = 6.0% × (1 - 0.25) = 4.5%
```

#### Market Values for WACC Weights

**Market Value of Equity (E)**:
```
E = Share Price × Shares Outstanding
```

**Market Value of Debt (D)**:
- For public debt: Use market value of outstanding bonds
- For private/bank debt: Book value often approximates market value
- Total Debt = Short-term Debt + Long-term Debt

**Example**:
```
Market Cap (E): $1,000M
Total Debt (D): $400M
Total Value (V): $1,400M

E/V = $1,000M / $1,400M = 71.4%
D/V = $400M / $1,400M = 28.6%
```

#### Complete WACC Example

```
Given:
Market Cap (E) = $1,000M
Total Debt (D) = $400M
Rf = 4.0%
β = 1.2
Market Risk Premium = 6.0%
Rd (pre-tax) = 6.0%
Tax Rate = 25%

Step 1: Cost of Equity
Re = 4.0% + 1.2 × 6.0% = 11.2%

Step 2: After-tax Cost of Debt
Rd (after-tax) = 6.0% × (1 - 0.25) = 4.5%

Step 3: Weights
E/V = $1,000M / $1,400M = 71.4%
D/V = $400M / $1,400M = 28.6%

Step 4: WACC
WACC = (71.4% × 11.2%) + (28.6% × 4.5%)
     = 8.0% + 1.3%
     = 9.3%
```

**Typical WACC Ranges**:
- **Mature companies**: 7-10%
- **Growth companies**: 9-12%
- **High-risk companies**: 12-15%+

### 2.8 Sensitivity Analysis

**Purpose**: Test DCF output sensitivity to key assumptions

**Two-Way Data Table**: Most common format

**Example 1: WACC vs. Terminal Growth**

|  | g = 2.0% | g = 2.5% | g = 3.0% |
|---|---------|---------|---------|
| **WACC = 8.5%** | $1,650M | $1,750M | $1,850M |
| **WACC = 9.0%** | $1,550M | $1,650M | $1,750M |
| **WACC = 9.5%** | $1,450M | $1,550M | $1,650M |

**Example 2: WACC vs. Exit Multiple**

|  | 9.0x | 10.0x | 11.0x |
|---|------|-------|-------|
| **WACC = 8.5%** | $1,580M | $1,720M | $1,860M |
| **WACC = 9.0%** | $1,520M | $1,650M | $1,780M |
| **WACC = 9.5%** | $1,460M | $1,580M | $1,700M |

**Excel Data Table Setup**:
1. Reference output cell (Enterprise Value) in top-left
2. Column input: WACC values
3. Row input: Terminal growth or exit multiple
4. Data → What-If Analysis → Data Table
5. Column input cell: WACC cell
6. Row input cell: Growth rate cell

**Interpretation**:
- Shows valuation range across reasonable assumptions
- Helps identify key value drivers
- Typical sensitivity: ±0.5% for WACC, ±0.5% for growth

### 2.9 Mid-Year Convention vs End-of-Year Discounting

**End-of-Year Convention** (Standard):
```
PV = FCF(t) / (1 + WACC)^t

Year 1: t = 1
Year 2: t = 2, etc.
```

**Mid-Year Convention** (More accurate):
```
PV = FCF(t) / (1 + WACC)^(t - 0.5)

Year 1: t = 0.5
Year 2: t = 1.5, etc.
```

**Logic**: Cash flows occur throughout year, not on Dec 31

**Impact**: Mid-year convention increases PV by ~4-5%

**Example**:
```
FCF Year 1 = $100M
WACC = 10%

End-of-year: PV = $100M / (1.10)^1 = $90.9M
Mid-year: PV = $100M / (1.10)^0.5 = $95.3M

Difference: $4.4M or 4.8% higher
```

**Industry Practice**: Mid-year is more common in investment banking

### 2.10 Common DCF Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

1. **Terminal Value Dominates Total Value**:
   - Problem: TV > 70-80% of Enterprise Value
   - Solution: Extend forecast period or reduce growth assumptions

2. **Inconsistent Terminal Assumptions**:
   - Problem: Using high growth rate with low CapEx/NWC
   - Solution: Ensure steady-state assumptions (CapEx ≈ D&A, stable NWC/Revenue)

3. **Mismatched Discount Rates**:
   - Problem: Discounting FCFE at WACC or vice versa
   - Solution: FCFF → WACC, FCFE → Cost of Equity

4. **Circular Reference Issues**:
   - Problem: WACC depends on D/V, but D is unknown
   - Solution: Use iterative calculation or target capital structure

5. **Forgetting Tax Shield on Interest**:
   - Problem: Using pre-tax cost of debt in WACC
   - Solution: Always use Rd × (1 - T)

6. **Unrealistic Growth Rates**:
   - Problem: Terminal growth > long-term GDP growth
   - Solution: Cap terminal growth at 2-3%

7. **Double-Counting Cash Flows**:
   - Problem: Including dividends in FCFF
   - Solution: FCFF represents all cash before distribution

8. **Not Adjusting for Non-Operating Items**:
   - Problem: Including one-time items in projections
   - Solution: Normalize historical financials

## 3. COMPARABLE COMPANY ANALYSIS (COMPS)

### 3.1 Selecting Truly Comparable Companies

**Comparability Criteria** (in order of importance):

1. **Industry/Business Model**: Same sector and business operations
2. **Size**: Similar revenue/market cap (within 0.5x - 2.0x)
3. **Geography**: Same region/country (regulatory, economic factors)
4. **Growth Profile**: Similar revenue growth rates (±5-10%)
5. **Profitability**: Similar margins
6. **End Markets**: Similar customer base

**Peer Group Size**:
- Minimum: 4-5 companies
- Ideal: 8-12 companies
- Maximum: 15-20 companies (too many dilutes comparability)

**Sources for Peers**:
- Company 10-K filings (list competitors)
- Equity research reports
- CapIQ peer analysis
- Bloomberg peer finder
- Industry association reports

### 3.2 Key Trading Multiples

#### Enterprise Value (EV) Multiples

**EV/Revenue**:
```
EV/Revenue = Enterprise Value / Last Twelve Months (LTM) Revenue
```
- **When to Use**: Unprofitable high-growth companies, early-stage tech
- **Typical Ranges**:
  - SaaS: 5-15x
  - E-commerce: 1-3x
  - Mature tech: 2-5x

**EV/EBITDA**:
```
EV/EBITDA = Enterprise Value / LTM EBITDA
```
- **When to Use**: Most common multiple for profitable companies
- **Typical Ranges**:
  - Tech/Software: 12-20x
  - Healthcare: 10-15x
  - Industrials: 8-12x
  - Retail: 6-10x

**EV/EBIT**:
```
EV/EBIT = Enterprise Value / LTM EBIT
```
- **When to Use**: Capital-intensive industries where D&A is significant
- **Typical Range**: 10-15x

#### Equity Value Multiples

**P/E (Price-to-Earnings)**:
```
P/E = Market Cap / Net Income
Or: Share Price / Earnings per Share (EPS)
```
- **Trailing P/E**: Uses LTM earnings
- **Forward P/E**: Uses next 12 months (NTM) consensus estimates
- **Typical Ranges**:
  - S&P 500 average: 15-20x
  - Growth stocks: 25-40x+
  - Value stocks: 10-15x

**P/B (Price-to-Book)**:
```
P/B = Market Cap / Shareholders' Equity
```
- **When to Use**: Banks, financial institutions, asset-heavy companies
- **Typical Range**: 1.0-3.0x for most companies

**PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth)**:
```
PEG = P/E Ratio / Annual EPS Growth Rate %

Example:
P/E = 30
Expected EPS Growth = 25%
PEG = 30 / 25 = 1.2
```
- **Interpretation**:
  - PEG < 1.0: Potentially undervalued
  - PEG = 1.0: Fairly valued
  - PEG > 1.0: Potentially overvalued
- **When to Use**: High-growth companies with positive earnings

### 3.3 Calculating Enterprise Value

**Enterprise Value Formula**:
```
Enterprise Value (EV) = Market Capitalization
                        + Total Debt
                        + Preferred Stock
                        + Minority Interest
                        - Cash and Cash Equivalents
```

**Detailed Calculation**:

**Market Capitalization**:
```
Market Cap = Share Price × Diluted Shares Outstanding
```
- Use diluted shares (includes options, warrants, convertibles)

**Total Debt**:
```
Total Debt = Short-term Debt
           + Current Portion of Long-term Debt
           + Long-term Debt
           + Capital Leases (post-IFRS 16)
```

**Cash and Cash Equivalents**:
- Cash, short-term investments, marketable securities
- **Logic**: Buyer gets cash, reduces effective purchase price

**Minority Interest** (Non-Controlling Interest):
- Portion of subsidiary not owned (if company has <100% stake)
- **Logic**: Represents claim on subsidiary's value

**Preferred Stock**:
- Redemption value of preferred shares
- **Logic**: Preferreds have priority over common equity

**Example**:
```
Market Cap: $1,000M
Total Debt: $300M
Cash: $100M
Minority Interest: $20M
Preferred Stock: $50M

EV = $1,000M + $300M + $50M + $20M - $100M = $1,270M
```

### 3.4 EV to Equity Value Bridge

**From EV to Equity Value**:
```
Equity Value = Enterprise Value
               - Total Debt
               - Preferred Stock
               - Minority Interest
               + Cash
```

**From Equity Value to EV**:
```
Enterprise Value = Market Cap
                   + Debt-like items
                   - Cash-like items
```

**Why This Matters**:
- EV multiples (EV/EBITDA) value entire firm
- Equity multiples (P/E) value only common equity
- Must use correct numerator/denominator pairing

### 3.5 Normalizing Multiples

**Outlier Treatment**:

**Method 1: Remove Statistical Outliers**:
- Calculate mean and standard deviation
- Remove values > 2 standard deviations from mean

**Method 2: Industry Knowledge**:
- Remove companies with one-time events (M&A, restructuring)
- Exclude companies with different business models

**Method 3: Use Median Instead of Mean**:
- Median is less sensitive to outliers
- Preferred in investment banking

**Example**:
```
EV/EBITDA multiples for 7 comparables:
8.5x, 9.2x, 10.1x, 10.5x, 11.0x, 11.8x, 22.0x (outlier)

Mean = 11.9x (skewed by outlier)
Median = 10.5x (more representative)

Recommendation: Use median or exclude 22.0x outlier
```

### 3.6 When to Use Forward vs Trailing Multiples

**Trailing (LTM - Last Twelve Months)**:
- Based on actual reported results
- More reliable, less speculative
- Standard in comps analysis

**Forward (NTM - Next Twelve Months)**:
- Based on consensus analyst estimates
- Better for high-growth companies
- Accounts for near-term changes

**Calendar Year (CY) Estimates**:
- CY 2025E, CY 2026E
- Standardizes fiscal year differences

**Best Practice**: Show both trailing and forward
```
Company A:
EV/EBITDA (LTM): 12.5x
EV/EBITDA (NTM): 10.8x
(Multiple compresses as EBITDA grows)
```

### 3.7 Applying Discounts

**Illiquidity Discount (20-35%)**:
- Applied to private companies
- Accounts for lack of public market
- See Section 8 for detailed DLOM discussion

**Size Discount**:
- Small cap premium: 2-5%
- Based on empirical studies showing small cap underperformance
- Applied to companies < $500M market cap

**Control Discount** (Minority Interest Discount):
- 15-30% for minority stakes
- Opposite of control premium
- Limited influence over company decisions

### 3.8 How to Present Comps in a Football Field Chart

**Football Field Chart**: Visual valuation summary

**Structure**:
```
|----Trading Comps----|
         |----Precedent Transactions----|
                  |----DCF----|
|___________________________________|
$800M         $1,000M        $1,200M
```

**Steps to Create**:

1. **Calculate Valuation Ranges** for each method:
```
Trading Comps:
Low: 25th percentile multiple × Company metric
High: 75th percentile multiple × Company metric

Example:
Company EBITDA: $100M
Comps range: 8.0x - 12.0x
Low: 8.0x × $100M = $800M
High: 12.0x × $100M = $1,200M
```

2. **Apply to Target Company**:
- Use target's LTM or NTM financials
- Apply multiple range from comps

3. **Add Reference Points**:
- Current market price (if public)
- Offer price (in M&A context)

4. **Format**:
- Horizontal bars for each method
- X-axis: Valuation ($)
- Color coding: Blue = comps, Red = transactions, Green = DCF

**Interpretation**:
- Overlap = consensus valuation range
- Outliers = further investigation needed
- DCF typically widest range (most assumptions)

---

## 4. PRECEDENT TRANSACTION ANALYSIS

### 4.1 Finding Relevant M&A Transactions

**Data Sources**:
- CapIQ, FactSet, Mergermarket (premium databases)
- SEC filings (DEFM14A for merger proxies)
- Company press releases
- Thomson Reuters, PitchBook (M&A databases)

**Search Criteria**:
1. **Industry**: Same sector as target
2. **Time Period**: Last 2-5 years (more recent = more relevant)
3. **Transaction Size**: Within 0.5x - 2.0x of target size
4. **Geography**: Same region
5. **Deal Type**: Strategic acquisition (not bankruptcy sales)

**Minimum Sample Size**: 5-10 transactions

### 4.2 Transaction Multiples vs Trading Multiples

**Key Difference**: Transaction multiples include **control premium**

**Typical Relationships**:
```
Transaction EV/EBITDA = Trading EV/EBITDA + Control Premium

Example:
Trading Multiple: 10.0x
Control Premium: 25%
Transaction Multiple: 10.0x × 1.25 = 12.5x
```

**Why Transaction Multiples Are Higher**:
1. **Control Premium**: Buyer pays for control
2. **Synergies**: Strategic value from combination
3. **Competition**: Multiple bidders drive up price

**Typical Premium Ranges**:
- Strategic buyers: 25-40% premium
- Financial buyers (PE): 20-30% premium
- Hostile takeovers: 30-50% premium

### 4.3 Control Premium Calculation

**Formula**:
```
Control Premium % = (Offer Price - Unaffected Stock Price) / Unaffected Stock Price × 100
```

**Unaffected Stock Price**: Trading price 1 day (or 1 week) before announcement

**Example**:
```
Unaffected Stock Price (day before announcement): $50
Offer Price: $65

Control Premium = ($65 - $50) / $50 × 100 = 30%
```

**Factors Affecting Premium Size**:
- **Synergy potential**: Higher synergies = higher premium
- **Competitive situation**: Multiple bidders increase premium
- **Market conditions**: Bull markets command higher premiums
- **Target's performance**: Struggling companies may have lower premiums
- **Buyer type**: Strategic buyers pay more than financial buyers

**Historical Averages (US Market)**:
- Median control premium: 25-30%
- Range: 15-50%+
- Hostile deals: 10-15% higher than friendly deals

### 4.4 Synergies and Impact on Valuation

**Types of Synergies**:

**Revenue Synergies**:
- Cross-selling opportunities
- Expanded distribution channels
- New product offerings
- Geographic expansion
- Harder to realize, longer timeframe

**Cost Synergies**:
- Headcount reduction (eliminate overlap)
- Facility consolidation
- Procurement savings (volume discounts)
- Technology platform consolidation
- Easier to realize, shorter timeframe (12-24 months)

**Synergy Valuation**:
```
PV of Synergies = Annual Run-rate Synergies / WACC

Example:
Cost Synergies: $50M/year (steady state)
WACC: 10%

PV = $50M / 0.10 = $500M
```

**Synergy Realization Curve**:
```
Year 1: 20% of run-rate ($10M)
Year 2: 50% of run-rate ($25M)
Year 3: 80% of run-rate ($40M)
Year 4+: 100% of run-rate ($50M)
```

**Synergy Adjustments in Valuation**:
- **Buyer's Perspective**: Include synergies (willing to pay more)
- **Seller's Perspective**: Exclude synergies (value standalone)
- **Fairness Opinion**: Typically excludes synergies

### 4.5 Deal Structure Considerations

**Cash vs. Stock Deals**:

**All-Cash**:
- Certainty of value
- Immediate liquidity for seller
- Buyer needs financing or cash reserves
- Taxable event for seller

**All-Stock**:
- Seller participates in upside/downside
- No immediate tax for seller (if structured as tax-free reorganization)
- Dilutive to buyer's shareholders
- Exchange ratio risk (stock price fluctuation)

**Mixed (Cash + Stock)**:
- Balances benefits of both
- Collar structures protect against price movements

**Example**:
```
Offer: $60/share
Structure: 50% cash, 50% stock

Seller receives:
$30 cash + Stock worth $30
If buyer's stock price increases 20%, total value = $30 + $36 = $66
```

### 4.6 When Precedent Transactions Are More Reliable Than Comps

**Precedent Transactions Preferred When**:

1. **Active M&A Market**: Frequent transactions in sector
2. **Private Company Valuation**: No trading comps available
3. **Strategic Value Important**: Synergies are significant
4. **Control Transaction**: Valuing acquisition, not minority stake
5. **Recent Comparable Deals**: Transactions in last 12-24 months

**Trading Comps Preferred When**:

1. **No Recent Transactions**: Stale transaction data
2. **Different Deal Structures**: Past deals not comparable (distressed, bankruptcy)
3. **Minority Valuation**: Valuing minority stake
4. **Market Conditions Changed**: Economic shifts since transactions
5. **Unique Synergies**: Past deals had buyer-specific synergies

**Best Practice**: Use both methods and triangulate

## 5. LBO (LEVERAGED BUYOUT) MODEL

### 5.1 Complete LBO Model Structure

**LBO Overview**: Private equity firm acquires company using significant debt

**Key Components**:
1. Sources & Uses of Funds
2. Transaction Assumptions
3. Debt Schedule and Paydown
4. Financial Projections (5-7 years)
5. Exit Assumptions and Returns (IRR, MOIC)

**LBO Returns Logic**:
```
Returns driven by:
1. EBITDA growth (operational improvement)
2. Debt paydown (equity value increases)
3. Multiple expansion (sell at higher multiple)
```

### 5.2 Sources & Uses

**Uses of Funds** (How money is spent):
```
Purchase Equity: [Purchase Price - Seller's Debt + Seller's Cash]
Refinance/Repay Seller Debt: [Seller's existing debt paid off]
Transaction Fees: [2-3% of deal value]
Financing Fees: [2-3% of debt raised]
────────────────
Total Uses
```

**Sources of Funds** (How deal is financed):
```
Debt:
  Revolver: [Undrawn initially]
  Term Loan A: [~2-3x EBITDA]
  Term Loan B: [~3-4x EBITDA]
  Senior Notes: [~1-2x EBITDA]
  Subordinated/Mezzanine: [~0.5-1x EBITDA]
Equity:
  Sponsor Equity: [PE firm investment]
  Management Rollover: [Management keeps stake]
────────────────
Total Sources
```

**Sources = Uses** (must balance)

**Example**:
```
Uses:
Purchase Enterprise Value: $1,000M
Repay Seller Debt: $200M
Fees: $30M
Total Uses: $1,230M

Sources:
Revolver (undrawn): $0M
Term Loan: $500M
Senior Notes: $200M
Equity: $530M
Total Sources: $1,230M

Leverage Ratio = $700M debt / $150M EBITDA = 4.7x
Equity % = $530M / $1,230M = 43%
```

### 5.3 Debt Structure

**Typical LBO Debt Stack** (from senior to junior):

**1. Revolver (Revolving Credit Facility)**:
- Size: 10-15% of total debt, or $10-30M minimum
- Purpose: Working capital, not drawn at close
- Pricing: LIBOR/SOFR + 250-350 bps
- Maturity: 5-6 years
- Security: First lien on assets
- Covenants: Most restrictive

**2. Term Loan A (Amortizing)**:
- Size: 2-3x EBITDA
- Pricing: LIBOR/SOFR + 300-400 bps
- Maturity: 5-7 years
- Amortization: 5-10% per year (mandatory)
- Security: First lien (pari passu with revolver)

**3. Term Loan B (Institutional)**:
- Size: 3-4x EBITDA
- Pricing: LIBOR/SOFR + 375-475 bps
- Maturity: 7-8 years
- Amortization: 1% per year (minimal)
- Security: First lien
- Covenants: Lighter than Term Loan A (cov-lite)

**4. Senior Notes (Bonds)**:
- Size: 1-2x EBITDA
- Pricing: Fixed rate 6-8%
- Maturity: 8-10 years
- Amortization: Bullet (pay at maturity)
- Security: Second lien or unsecured
- Covenants: Light

**5. Subordinated/Mezzanine Debt**:
- Size: 0.5-1x EBITDA
- Pricing: 10-14% (cash + PIK)
- Maturity: 8-10 years
- Security: Unsecured, subordinated
- Often includes equity warrants

**Total Leverage Ranges**:
- **Conservative LBO**: 3-4x Debt/EBITDA
- **Standard LBO**: 4-6x Debt/EBITDA
- **Aggressive LBO**: 6-8x Debt/EBITDA

**Example Debt Structure**:
```
EBITDA: $150M

Revolver: $50M (undrawn)
Term Loan A: $300M (2.0x)
Term Loan B: $450M (3.0x)
Senior Notes: $150M (1.0x)
─────────────
Total Debt: $950M (6.3x EBITDA)
```

### 5.4 Debt Paydown Waterfall

**Mandatory Amortization** (Required Principal Payments):
```
Order of Paydown:
1. Term Loan A: 5-10%/year
2. Term Loan B: 1%/year
3. Senior Notes: None (bullet)
4. Sub Debt: None (bullet)
```

**Cash Sweep** (Excess Cash Flow Sweep):
```
Excess Cash = CFO - CapEx - ΔNWC - Mandatory Debt Service - Min Cash Balance

Cash Sweep % (typical):
Leverage > 5.0x: 75% sweep
Leverage 3.0-5.0x: 50% sweep
Leverage < 3.0x: 25% sweep

Order of Optional Prepayment:
1. Highest cost debt first (Mezzanine)
2. Then Senior Notes
3. Then Term Loans
```

**Example**:
```
CFO: $200M
CapEx: $50M
ΔNWC: $10M
Mandatory Debt Service: $30M
Min Cash Balance: $10M

Excess Cash = $200M - $50M - $10M - $30M - $10M = $100M

If Debt/EBITDA = 5.5x → 75% sweep
Cash Sweep = $100M × 75% = $75M
(Applied to highest cost debt first)
```

### 5.5 Returns Calculation: IRR and MOIC

**Multiple on Invested Capital (MOIC)**:
```
MOIC = Exit Equity Value / Initial Equity Investment

Example:
Initial Equity: $500M
Exit Equity Value: $1,250M
MOIC = $1,250M / $500M = 2.5x
```

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**:
```
IRR = (Exit Value / Entry Value)^(1/Years) - 1

Example:
Entry: $500M
Exit: $1,250M
Holding Period: 5 years

IRR = ($1,250M / $500M)^(1/5) - 1
    = (2.5)^0.2 - 1
    = 1.201 - 1
    = 20.1%
```

**Excel IRR Function**:
```
Year 0: -$500M (equity investment)
Year 1-4: $0
Year 5: $1,250M (exit proceeds)

IRR = 20.1%
```

**Target Returns**:
- **Minimum Acceptable**: 15-20% IRR
- **Target**: 20-25% IRR
- **Excellent**: 25-30%+ IRR
- **MOIC Target**: 2.0-3.0x

### 5.6 Exit Assumptions

**Exit Methods**:
1. **Strategic Sale**: Sold to strategic buyer (most common)
2. **IPO**: Public offering
3. **Secondary Buyout**: Sold to another PE firm
4. **Dividend Recapitalization**: Partial exit via debt-financed dividend

**Exit Timing**: Typical holding period 5-7 years

**Exit Multiple Method**:
```
Exit Enterprise Value = Exit EBITDA × Exit Multiple

Conservative Assumption: Exit Multiple = Entry Multiple
Or: Exit Multiple based on current comps (adjusted down 10-20%)

Example:
Year 5 EBITDA: $200M
Entry Multiple: 10.0x
Exit Multiple: 10.0x (conservative)

Exit EV = $200M × 10.0x = $2,000M
Less: Remaining Debt = -$350M
Exit Equity Value = $1,650M
```

**Bridge to Equity Value**:
```
Exit Enterprise Value: $2,000M
- Net Debt at Exit: -$350M
- Transaction Costs (1%): -$20M
= Exit Equity Proceeds: $1,630M

Initial Equity: $500M
MOIC = $1,630M / $500M = 3.26x
IRR (5 years) = (3.26)^(1/5) - 1 = 26.6%
```

### 5.7 Management Rollover Equity

**Rollover**: Management keeps equity stake in LBO

**Typical Structure**:
- Management sells 60-80% of shares for cash
- Rolls over 20-40% into new entity
- Aligns interests with PE sponsor

**Example**:
```
Pre-LBO: Management owns $50M equity stake

Rollover Terms:
- Sell $30M for cash (60%)
- Rollover $20M (40%)

Post-LBO Ownership:
- PE Sponsor: $480M (96%)
- Management: $20M (4%)

At Exit (3.0x MOIC):
- PE gets: $480M × 3.0 = $1,440M
- Management gets: $20M × 3.0 = $60M
- Total to Management: $30M (cash at entry) + $60M (at exit) = $90M
```

### 5.8 Operational Improvements and Value Creation

**LBO Value Creation Levers**:

**1. Revenue Growth** (20-30% of value creation):
- Organic growth initiatives
- Add-on acquisitions
- Geographic expansion
- New product development

**2. EBITDA Margin Expansion** (30-40% of value creation):
- Cost reduction programs
- Procurement optimization
- Headcount optimization
- Process improvements
- Typical target: +200-500 bps margin expansion

**3. Debt Paydown** (20-30% of value creation):
- Excess cash flow used to repay debt
- Equity value increases as debt decreases

**4. Multiple Expansion** (10-20% of value creation):
- Exit at higher multiple than entry
- Requires market improvement or positioning changes
- Least reliable lever (market-dependent)

**Example Value Creation**:
```
Entry:
Revenue: $500M
EBITDA: $100M (20% margin)
EV: $1,000M (10.0x multiple)
Debt: $600M
Equity: $400M

Exit (Year 5):
Revenue: $700M (+40% growth, 7% CAGR)
EBITDA: $175M (25% margin, +500 bps)
EV: $1,925M (11.0x multiple)
Debt: $200M (-$400M paydown)
Equity: $1,725M

MOIC = $1,725M / $400M = 4.3x
IRR = 34%

Value Creation Attribution:
Revenue growth: $350M (20%)
Margin expansion: $875M (51%)
Debt paydown: $400M (23%)
Multiple expansion: $100M (6%)
```

## 6. FORECASTING & PROJECTIONS

### 6.1 Historical Analysis: 3-5 Years of Financials

**Purpose**: Establish baseline trends and patterns

**Key Metrics to Analyze**:

**Growth Rates**:
```
Revenue CAGR (5-year):
CAGR = (Revenue(Year 5) / Revenue(Year 0))^(1/5) - 1

YoY Growth:
Year 1: (Rev(1) / Rev(0)) - 1
Year 2: (Rev(2) / Rev(1)) - 1
etc.
```

**Margin Trends**:
- Gross margin progression
- EBITDA margin evolution
- Operating leverage analysis (margins expand with scale?)

**Working Capital Patterns**:
- NWC as % of revenue
- Seasonal patterns in A/R, inventory, A/P
- Cash conversion cycle trends

**CapEx Intensity**:
- CapEx as % of revenue
- CapEx vs. Depreciation (maintenance vs. growth CapEx)

### 6.2 Revenue Forecasting Methods

#### Top-Down (Market Size × Market Share)

**Formula**:
```
Revenue = Total Addressable Market (TAM)
          × Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) %
          × Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) %
          × Market Share %
```

**Example (B2B SaaS Company)**:
```
TAM (Global Enterprise Software): $500B
SAM (SMB CRM in US): 5% of TAM = $25B
SOM (Realistic target): 20% of SAM = $5B
Market Share (Year 5 target): 4%

Projected Revenue = $5B × 4% = $200M
```

**Advantages**:
- Quick high-level estimate
- Useful when internal data is limited
- Strategic view of market opportunity

**Disadvantages**:
- Can be overly optimistic
- Difficult to validate TAM/SAM assumptions
- Ignores operational constraints

#### Bottom-Up (Units × Price)

**Formula**:
```
Revenue = Number of Units × Average Selling Price (ASP)

For SaaS:
Revenue = Number of Customers × Annual Contract Value (ACV)
```

**Example (SaaS Company)**:
```
Year 1:
Beginning Customers: 1,000
New Customer Adds: 400
Churn: -150
Ending Customers: 1,250

ACV: $50,000

Year 1 Revenue = 1,250 × $50,000 = $62.5M
```

**Cohort Analysis**:
```
Year 1 Cohort (500 customers):
Year 1 retention: 85% → 425 customers
Year 2 retention: 90% → 383 customers
Year 3 retention: 92% → 352 customers

ACV expansion: 10% per year
Year 1: $50K
Year 2: $55K
Year 3: $60.5K

Year 3 Revenue from Year 1 Cohort = 352 × $60.5K = $21.3M
```

**Advantages**:
- Grounded in operational reality
- Validates top-down estimates
- Detailed driver analysis

**Disadvantages**:
- Data-intensive
- May miss macro trends
- Can be too granular

#### Trend Analysis and Regression

**Simple Linear Regression**:
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Historical revenue
years = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).reshape(-1, 1)
revenue = np.array([100, 120, 145, 175, 210])

# Fit model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(years, revenue)

# Forecast
year_6_forecast = model.predict([[6]])
# Output: ~$245M
```

**Exponential Growth (CAGR-Based)**:
```
Revenue(t) = Revenue(0) × (1 + CAGR)^t

Example:
Year 0: $100M
CAGR: 15%

Year 5 = $100M × (1.15)^5 = $201M
```

**Advantages**:
- Objective, formula-driven
- Easy to implement

**Disadvantages**:
- Assumes historical trends continue
- Doesn't account for market changes
- Can produce unrealistic results if extrapolated too far

**Best Practice**: Combine all three methods

```
Revenue Forecast Validation:
Top-Down: $200M
Bottom-Up: $180M
Trend/Regression: $190M

Use: $185M (average or weighted average based on confidence)
```

### 6.3 Expense Forecasting: Fixed vs Variable Costs

**Variable Costs** (Scale with revenue):
```
COGS % = COGS / Revenue

Historical Analysis:
Year 1: 60%
Year 2: 58%
Year 3: 57% (improving due to scale)

Forecast: 56% (continued efficiency gains)
```

**Fixed Costs** (Independent of revenue):
- Rent
- Base salaries (before growth)
- Insurance
- Software licenses

**Semi-Variable Costs**:
- Sales commissions (% of revenue)
- Customer support (scales with customers, but stepwise)
- R&D (% of revenue or fixed budget)

**Operating Leverage**:
```
Example:
Revenue: $100M → $150M (+50%)
Fixed Costs: $30M (unchanged)
Variable Costs (60% of rev): $60M → $90M

EBITDA:
Before: $100M - $60M - $30M = $10M (10% margin)
After: $150M - $90M - $30M = $30M (20% margin)

Operating leverage: EBITDA grows 200% while revenue grows 50%
```

**Expense Ratio Guidelines**:

| Expense | Asset-Light | Asset-Heavy |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| COGS % | 15-30% | 60-75% |
| R&D % | 15-25% | 3-8% |
| S&M % | 30-50% | 5-15% |
| G&A % | 10-20% | 8-15% |

### 6.4 Balance Sheet Forecasting

**Plug Analysis**: Balancing the balance sheet

**Method**: Use cash or debt as the "plug" to balance

**Operating Assets/Liabilities** (driver-based):
```
A/R = Revenue × (DSO / 365)
Inventory = COGS × (DIO / 365)
A/P = COGS × (DPO / 365)

Example:
Revenue: $500M
DSO: 45 days

A/R = $500M × (45 / 365) = $61.6M
```

**PP&E Forecast**:
```
PP&E(ending) = PP&E(beginning) + CapEx - Depreciation

Example:
PP&E(beginning): $200M
CapEx: $50M
Depreciation: $30M

PP&E(ending) = $200M + $50M - $30M = $220M
```

**Shareholders' Equity**:
```
Equity(ending) = Equity(beginning)
                 + Net Income
                 - Dividends
                 + Share Issuance
                 - Share Repurchases
```

**Plug (Revolver or Cash)**:
```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity

If Assets > Liabilities + Equity → Need to reduce Assets (pay down cash) or increase Liabilities (draw revolver)
If Assets < Liabilities + Equity → Excess cash or pay down debt
```

### 6.5 Circular References: Debt Schedule and Interest

**The Problem**:
```
Interest Expense depends on Debt Balance
Debt Balance depends on Cash Flow
Cash Flow depends on Net Income
Net Income depends on Interest Expense
→ Circular Reference
```

**Solution 1: Iterative Calculation (Excel)**:
- Enable: File → Options → Formulas → Enable Iterative Calculation
- Set Max Iterations: 100
- Set Max Change: 0.001

**Solution 2: Average Debt Balance**:
```
Interest = Average Debt × Interest Rate

Average Debt = (Beginning Debt + Ending Debt) / 2
```
- Less precise but avoids circularity

**Solution 3: Prior Period Debt**:
```
Interest(Year 2) = Debt(Year 1 ending) × Interest Rate
```
- Simple but lags one period

**Best Practice**: Use iterative calculation in Excel

**Example**:
```
Beginning Debt: $500M
Interest Rate: 6%

Iteration 1:
Interest = $500M × 6% = $30M
Net Income = EBIT - $30M - Tax
FCF = Net Income + D&A - CapEx - ΔNWC
Debt Paydown = FCF
Ending Debt = $500M - Paydown

Iteration 2:
Recalculate Interest using new Ending Debt estimate
Repeat until Ending Debt converges
```

### 6.6 Scenario Analysis: Base, Upside, Downside

**Three-Scenario Framework**:

**Base Case** (P50 - 50% probability):
- Most likely outcome
- Reasonable assumptions
- Management guidance + analyst adjustments

**Upside Case** (P75-P90):
- Optimistic but achievable
- Strong market conditions
- Successful execution of initiatives
- Typically: Revenue +15-25% vs. base, Margin +200-300 bps

**Downside Case** (P10-P25):
- Pessimistic scenario
- Economic downturn or execution risks
- Typically: Revenue -10-20% vs. base, Margin -100-200 bps

**Example**:

| Metric | Downside | Base | Upside |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| Revenue CAGR | 5% | 10% | 15% |
| EBITDA Margin (Y5) | 18% | 22% | 26% |
| Exit Multiple | 8.0x | 10.0x | 12.0x |
| IRR | 12% | 20% | 28% |

**Monte Carlo Simulation** (Advanced):
- Assign probability distributions to key inputs
- Run thousands of scenarios
- Output: probability distribution of outcomes
- Tools: @Risk, Crystal Ball, Python

## 7. INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

### 7.1 High-Growth Tech Companies

**Valuation Challenges**:
- Often unprofitable (negative Net Income)
- High burn rate (negative FCF)
- Valuation based on growth potential

**Preferred Multiples**:
- **EV/Revenue**: Primary multiple
- **EV/Gross Profit**: If COGS varies significantly
- **Price/Sales (P/S)**: For equity value

**Typical Ranges (SaaS)**:
- EV/Revenue: 5-15x (varies by growth rate)
- Rule of 40: Growth % + FCF Margin % ≥ 40%

**Key Metrics**:
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Lifetime Value (LTV)
- LTV/CAC Ratio: Target > 3.0x
- Net Revenue Retention (NRR): Target > 110%

**DCF Adjustments**:
- Longer forecast period (7-10 years to profitability)
- Terminal value only after achieving steady-state margins
- Higher discount rate (12-15% WACC for risk)

### 7.2 Banks and Financial Institutions

**Why EV-based multiples don't work**:
- Debt is not financing; it's raw material (deposits are liabilities used to make loans)
- EBITDA not meaningful (interest is core business, not financing cost)

**Preferred Multiples**:
- **P/E (Price-to-Earnings)**: Most common
- **P/B (Price-to-Book)**: Tangible Book Value
- **P/TBV (Price-to-Tangible Book Value)**: Excludes goodwill

**Typical Ranges**:
- Large banks: P/E 10-15x, P/B 1.0-2.0x
- Regional banks: P/E 8-12x, P/B 0.8-1.5x

**Key Metrics**:
- Return on Equity (ROE): Target > 12-15%
- Return on Assets (ROA): Target > 1.0%
- Net Interest Margin (NIM): 3-4%
- Efficiency Ratio: < 60% (Non-Interest Expense / Revenue)
- Tier 1 Capital Ratio: > 10% (regulatory requirement)
- Non-Performing Loans (NPL) Ratio: < 2%

**Valuation Method**:
- Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
- Residual Income Model (RIM)

### 7.3 Real Estate (REITs)

**Core Metrics**:
- **FFO (Funds From Operations)**:
```
FFO = Net Income
      + Depreciation & Amortization (real estate)
      - Gains on Sales of Property

Rationale: Depreciation doesn't reflect economic reality (property often appreciates)
```

- **AFFO (Adjusted FFO)**:
```
AFFO = FFO
       - Maintenance CapEx
       - Straight-line rent adjustments

Closer to true cash flow
```

**Preferred Multiples**:
- **P/FFO**: Similar to P/E for REITs
- **Price/AFFO**: More conservative
- **Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)**:
```
Cap Rate = Net Operating Income (NOI) / Property Value

Example:
NOI: $10M
Property Value: $150M
Cap Rate = $10M / $150M = 6.7%

Lower cap rate = higher valuation (inverse relationship)
```

**Typical Ranges**:
- P/FFO: 12-20x
- Cap Rates: 4-8% (varies by property type and location)

**Property Types**:
- Office: Cap Rate 6-8%
- Retail: Cap Rate 6-9%
- Industrial: Cap Rate 5-7%
- Multifamily: Cap Rate 4-6%

### 7.4 Retail and Consumer

**Key Metrics**:
- **Same-Store Sales (SSS) Growth**: Comparable store sales growth excluding new/closed stores
  - Target: +2-5% annually
  - Critical indicator of brand health

- **Sales per Square Foot**:
```
Sales/SF = Total Sales / Total Retail Square Footage

Benchmarks:
- Apple Store: $5,000+/SF
- Luxury retail: $1,000-2,000/SF
- Department stores: $200-400/SF
```

**Inventory Turnover**:
- Grocery: 12-16x per year
- Apparel: 4-6x per year
- Electronics: 6-10x per year

**Valuation Multiples**:
- EV/EBITDA: 6-12x (varies by segment)
- P/E: 12-20x
- EV/Revenue: 0.3-1.5x

### 7.5 Biotech/Pharma

**Valuation Challenges**:
- Long development timelines (10-15 years)
- Binary outcomes (FDA approval or rejection)
- High failure rates (90%+ of drugs fail)

**Probability-Weighted DCF** (rNPV - risk-adjusted NPV):

**Formula**:
```
rNPV = Σ [Probability of Success × PV of Cash Flows at Each Stage]

Stages:
- Preclinical: 10% probability
- Phase I: 20% probability
- Phase II: 30% probability
- Phase III: 60% probability
- FDA Approval: 85% probability
```

**Example**:
```
Drug Candidate:
Currently in Phase II
Probability of Success (Phase II → Approval): 30% × 60% × 85% = 15.3%

Peak Sales (if approved): $500M/year
PV of Future Cash Flows: $2,000M

rNPV = 15.3% × $2,000M = $306M
```

**Discount Rate**:
- Early-stage biotech: 12-18% (high risk)
- Late-stage: 8-12%

**Pipeline Valuation**:
- Sum-of-the-parts: Value each drug candidate separately
- Platform value: Add value for technology platform

## 8. PRIVATE COMPANY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS

### 8.1 Discount for Lack of Marketability (DLOM)

**Definition**: Reduction in value due to inability to quickly sell shares

**Typical Range**: 20-35% discount

**Studies**:
- **Restricted Stock Studies**: Average discount 25-30%
- **Pre-IPO Studies**: Average discount 40-50%

**Factors Affecting DLOM**:
1. **Holding Period**: Longer expected hold = higher discount
2. **Company Size**: Smaller companies = higher discount
3. **Profitability**: Unprofitable = higher discount
4. **Volatility**: Higher volatility = higher discount
5. **Dividend Policy**: No dividends = higher discount

**Methods to Quantify**:

**1. Restricted Stock Method**:
- Compare restricted stock prices to freely-traded stock
- Average discount: 25-35%

**2. Pre-IPO Method**:
- Compare private sale price to IPO price
- Average discount: 40-60%

**3. Option Pricing Models**:
- Finnerty Model
- Longstaff Model
- Chaffe Model

**Application**:
```
DCF Equity Value: $1,000M
DLOM: 25%

Private Company Value = $1,000M × (1 - 0.25) = $750M
```

### 8.2 Size Premium

**Small Cap Premium**: Additional return required for small companies

**Historical Data** (Duff & Phelps):
- Micro-cap (< $500M): 3-5% premium
- Small-cap ($500M-$2B): 2-3% premium
- Mid-cap ($2B-$10B): 1-2% premium

**Application to Discount Rate**:
```
Base WACC: 10%
Size Premium: 3%

Adjusted WACC = 10% + 3% = 13%
```

### 8.3 Key Person Discount

**Definition**: Reduction in value due to dependence on key individual(s)

**Typical Range**: 5-25% discount

**Factors**:
- CEO/founder dependency
- Specialized knowledge not documented
- Customer relationships tied to individual
- No succession plan

**Mitigation**:
- Key person insurance
- Management team depth
- Documented processes
- Transition planning

**Application**:
```
Pre-Discount Value: $500M
Key Person Discount: 15%

Adjusted Value = $500M × (1 - 0.15) = $425M
```

### 8.4 Adjusting for Non-Operating Assets and Liabilities

**Non-Operating Assets** (Add to Enterprise Value):
- Excess cash (beyond operating needs)
- Marketable securities
- Real estate held for investment
- Equity investments in other companies

**Non-Operating Liabilities** (Subtract from Enterprise Value):
- Pension obligations (unfunded)
- Litigation reserves
- Environmental liabilities
- Earnout obligations

**Example**:
```
Operating Enterprise Value (DCF): $800M
+ Excess Cash: $50M
+ Investment in subsidiary: $30M
- Unfunded pension: -$20M
- Litigation reserve: -$10M
───────────────
Adjusted EV: $850M
```

### 8.5 Pro Forma Adjustments for Private Companies

**Normalize for Owner-Related Items**:

- Personal insurance

**3. Rent (if below market)**:
```
Rent Paid to Related Party: $100K
Market Rate Rent: $200K
Deduct: -$100K (understated expense)
```

**4. Non-Recurring Items**:
- One-time legal fees
- One-time bonuses
- Moving expenses

**Example Pro Forma EBITDA**:
```
Reported EBITDA: $10M
+ Excess Owner Comp: $250K
+ Personal Expenses: $150K
+ One-time Legal: $300K
- Below-Market Rent: -$100K
───────────────
Pro Forma EBITDA: $10.6M
```

### 9.3 Beta Calculation

**Regression Method**:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Get 2 years of weekly returns
stock_returns = [0.02, -0.01, 0.03, ...]  # Weekly stock returns
market_returns = [0.015, -0.005, 0.025, ...]  # S&P 500 weekly returns

# Regression: Stock Returns = α + β × Market Returns
X = np.array(market_returns).reshape(-1, 1)
y = np.array(stock_returns)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

beta_raw = model.coef_[0]
# Example output: β = 1.25
```

**Bloomberg Adjusted Beta**:
```
Adjusted Beta = 0.67 × Raw Beta + 0.33 × 1.0

Example:
Raw Beta = 1.5
Adjusted Beta = 0.67 × 1.5 + 0.33 = 1.34
```
- Logic: Beta tends to revert to 1.0 over time

**Unlevered Beta** (Asset Beta):
```
βu = βL / [1 + (1 - T) × (D/E)]

Example:
Levered Beta = 1.5
D/E = 0.5
Tax Rate = 25%

βu = 1.5 / [1 + (1 - 0.25) × 0.5]
   = 1.5 / 1.375
   = 1.09
```

## 10. BEST PRACTICES & COMMON ERRORS

### 10.1 Model Integrity

**Hardcoding vs. Formula-Driven**:

**Bad Practice**:
```
Revenue Year 1: 500  [hardcoded]
Revenue Year 2: 550  [hardcoded]
Revenue Year 3: 600  [hardcoded]
```

**Best Practice**:
```
Revenue Year 0: 500  [hardcoded assumption]
Growth Rate: 10%  [hardcoded assumption]

Revenue Year 1: = Revenue Year 0 × (1 + Growth Rate)
Revenue Year 2: = Revenue Year 1 × (1 + Growth Rate)
```

**Centralized Assumptions**:
- All key assumptions on one "Assumptions" tab
- Link to throughout model
- Easy to update and scenario test

### 10.2 Color Coding Conventions

**Standard Wall Street Color Scheme**:

| Cell Type | Font Color | Background | Use |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-----|
| **Hardcoded Inputs** | Blue | None | Historical data, key inputs |
| **Assumptions** | Blue | Yellow/Light Orange | Key drivers that may change |
| **Formulas** | Black | None | Calculations within sheet |
| **Links to Other Sheets** | Green | None | References to other tabs |
| **Links to Other Files** | Red | None | External workbook links |
| **Links to Data Providers** | Dark Red | None | Capital IQ, FactSet formulas |

**Example**:
```
Revenue (Historical): Blue font
Revenue Growth Assumption: Blue font, yellow background
Revenue (Forecast): = Prior Revenue × (1 + Growth) [Black font]
EBITDA from Summary Tab: =Summary!E20 [Green font]
```

### 10.3 Error Checking

**Common Excel Errors**:

**#DIV/0!**: Division by zero
```
Fix: Add error handling
= IFERROR(A1/B1, 0)
```

**#REF!**: Reference to deleted cell
```
Fix: Check for broken links, rebuild formula
```

**#VALUE!**: Wrong data type
```
Fix: Check cell formatting, ensure numbers not text
```

**Circular Reference**:
```
Warning appears when formula references itself
Fix: Enable iterative calculation or break circularity
```

**Negative Values Where Impossible**:
- Cash balance
- Inventory
- Shares outstanding

**Fix**: Add validation checks
```
= IF(Cash < 0, "ERROR: Negative Cash", Cash)
```

### 10.4 Sanity Checks

**WACC Reality Check**:
- Too Low (< 5%): Likely error in inputs
- Too High (> 20%): Risk premium or beta too high
- Expected Range: 7-15% for most companies

**Margin Reality Check**:
```
Gross Margin > EBITDA Margin > Operating Margin > Net Margin

Example:
Gross: 40%
EBITDA: 20%
Operating: 15%
Net: 10%
✓ Correct progression
```

**Growth Reality Check**:
- Revenue Growth > Market Growth: Gaining share (validate)
- Terminal Growth > GDP Growth: Unsustainable
- EBITDA Growth >> Revenue Growth: Margin expansion (validate)

**Balance Sheet Check**:
```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity

If not balanced: Find the plug or error
```

**Cash Flow Reconciliation**:
```
CFO + CFI + CFF = Change in Cash

If doesn't reconcile: Error in cash flow statement
```

### 10.5 Documentation

**Assumption Page**:
- List all key assumptions
- Source for each assumption
- Date of data
- Rationale for estimates

**Example**:
```
Assumption: Revenue CAGR 12%
Source: Historical 5-year CAGR of 10%, industry growth of 8%, management guidance of 15%
Rationale: Conservative midpoint between historical and guidance
Date: October 15, 2025
```

**Version Control**:
- File naming: ProjectName_Version_Date_Initials.xlsx
- Example: AcmeCorp_DCF_v3.2_20251024_JS.xlsx
- Track changes log on separate tab
- Save major versions separately

**Audit Trail**:
- Formula auditing (Trace Precedents/Dependents)
- Comment cells with complex logic
- Protect formula cells after QC

### 10.6 Common Modeling Mistakes

**1. Mismatched Units**:
```
❌ Revenue in millions, EBITDA in thousands
✓ Consistent units throughout (usually millions)
```

**2. Wrong Multiple Applied**:
```
❌ EV/EBITDA multiple × Net Income
✓ EV/EBITDA multiple × EBITDA
```

**3. Forgetting to Add Back D&A**:
```
❌ FCF = EBIT - Taxes - CapEx
✓ FCF = EBIT × (1-T) + D&A - CapEx - ΔNWC
```

**4. Using Book Value Instead of Market Value for WACC**:
```
❌ D/E using book value of debt/equity
✓ D/E using market value
```

**5. Not Tax-Effecting Cost of Debt**:
```
❌ WACC = E/V × Re + D/V × Rd
✓ WACC = E/V × Re + D/V × Rd × (1-T)
```

**6. Double-Counting Cash Flows**:
```
❌ Including dividends in FCFF calculation
✓ FCFF is before any distributions
```

**7. Inconsistent Timing**:
```
❌ Mixing fiscal years and calendar years
✓ Align all data to same period (fiscal or calendar)
```

**Within Each Sheet**:
- Headers: Clear labels, units specified
- Left-to-right time flow: Historical → Projected
- Consistent row structure across years

### 11.2 Formula Efficiency

**Avoid Volatile Functions** (recalculate on every change):

**Volatile (Avoid)**:
- `INDIRECT()`
- `OFFSET()`
- `NOW()`
- `TODAY()`
- `RAND()` / `RANDBETWEEN()`

**Non-Volatile (Preferred)**:
- Direct cell references: `=A1`
- `INDEX()` and `MATCH()`
- `VLOOKUP()` / `XLOOKUP()`

**Example**:
```
❌ Slow: = OFFSET(A1, 0, MATCH("2025", $A$1:$Z$1, 0))
✓ Fast: = INDEX($A$2:$Z$2, MATCH("2025", $A$1:$Z$1, 0))
```

**Array Formulas** (use sparingly):
- Powerful but resource-intensive
- Use for calculations that require them
- Avoid in large models

**Calculation Settings**:
- For large models: Manual calculation (Ctrl + Alt + F9)
- Enable iterative calculation only if needed

### 11.3 Named Ranges

**Benefits**:
- Makes formulas readable
- Easier to update
- Reduces errors

**Example**:
```
Define Name: "Revenue_Growth" = Assumptions!$B$5

Instead of: = $A10 * Assumptions!$B$5
Use: = $A10 * Revenue_Growth
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use for key assumptions
- Use underscores (no spaces)
- Descriptive names

**How to Create**:
- Select cell → Formulas → Define Name
- Or: Ctrl + F3 (Name Manager)

### 11.4 Data Validation and Input Controls

**Dropdown Lists**:
```
Scenario Selection:
Data → Data Validation → List
Source: Base Case, Upside Case, Downside Case
```

**Input Constraints**:
```
Growth Rate Input:
Data Validation → Custom
Formula: = AND(B5 >= 0, B5 <= 0.5)
Error Message: "Growth rate must be between 0% and 50%"
```

**Conditional Formatting** (highlight inputs):
```
Format → Conditional Formatting → New Rule
Format cells with: Blue background
Apply to: All assumption cells
```

**Error Alerts**:
```
= IF(EBITDA < 0, "WARNING: Negative EBITDA", EBITDA)
```

### 11.5 Scenario Manager and Data Tables

**Scenario Manager**:
- Excel tool for switching between assumption sets
- Data → What-If Analysis → Scenario Manager

**Setup**:
1. Define scenarios (Base, Upside, Downside)
2. Specify changing cells (assumptions)
3. Save scenario values
4. Generate Scenario Summary Report

**Data Tables** (for sensitivity analysis):

**One-Way Data Table**:
```
Varies one input (e.g., WACC)
Shows impact on output (e.g., Enterprise Value)

Setup:
Column: WACC values (8%, 9%, 10%)
Row: Enterprise Value formula
Data → What-If Analysis → Data Table
Column input cell: WACC assumption cell
```

**Two-Way Data Table**:
```
Varies two inputs (e.g., WACC and Terminal Growth)

Setup:
Row: WACC values
Column: Growth rate values
Top-left: Enterprise Value formula
Data → What-If Analysis → Data Table
Row input cell: WACC cell
Column input cell: Growth rate cell
```

**Result**: Matrix showing all combinations

## APPENDIX: QUICK REFERENCE FORMULAS

### Financial Ratios

```
Liquidity:
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities

Profitability:
Gross Margin % = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
EBITDA Margin % = EBITDA / Revenue
ROE % = Net Income / Equity
ROIC % = NOPAT / (Debt + Equity - Cash)

Leverage:
Debt/Equity = Total Debt / Total Equity
Debt/EBITDA = Total Debt / EBITDA
Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense

Efficiency:
Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Assets
Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory
DSO = 365 / (Revenue / Average A/R)
```

### DCF Formulas

```
FCFF = NOPAT + D&A - CapEx - ΔNWC
NOPAT = EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate)

Terminal Value (Perpetuity):
TV = FCF(final) × (1 + g) / (WACC - g)

Terminal Value (Exit Multiple):
TV = EBITDA(final) × Exit Multiple

Enterprise Value:
EV = PV(Explicit Period FCFs) + PV(Terminal Value)

Equity Value:
Equity Value = EV - Net Debt + Non-Op Assets

WACC = (E/V × Re) + (D/V × Rd × (1-T))
Re = Rf + β × (Rm - Rf)
```

### Valuation Multiples

```
EV/Revenue = Enterprise Value / LTM Revenue
EV/EBITDA = Enterprise Value / LTM EBITDA
P/E = Market Cap / Net Income
P/B = Market Cap / Equity
PEG = P/E / EPS Growth Rate
```

### LBO Formulas

```
MOIC = Exit Equity Value / Initial Equity
IRR = (Exit Value / Entry Value)^(1/Years) - 1

Leverage = Total Debt / EBITDA
Equity % = Equity / (Debt + Equity)
```

### Working Capital

```
NWC = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
Operating NWC = (A/R + Inventory) - A/P
ΔNWC = NWC(t) - NWC(t-1)
CCC = DIO + DSO - DPO
```
